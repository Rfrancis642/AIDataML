Neutral,"I don't think it's the most user friendly site. Also, I don't appreciate how Scholastic has raised the price so much that most of our families can't afford to get the books anymore.",TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Satisfied,It is annoying to me that the site works best in landscape over portrait on my iPad. I usually forget to turn it.,TRUE,Mobile Compatibility
Satisfied,"The search functions are a little antiquated, but I was able to complete, thanks!",TRUE,Filter/Search Options
Satisfied,"i wasn't able to find a way to search by topic, like self regulation.  I just had to hope it came up.  You should have a tab for kids on spectrum.  Maybe you do but it wasn't obvious.",TRUE,Filter/Search Options
Very Satisfied,"Some trouble logging in - didn't accept password, but overall easier than usual.  As I've said before your site doesn't do well with Mozilla and other browsers that focus on privacy which is annoying as I have to use chrome or edge - whichever will work that day.  Also, my biggest pain is trying to enter the due dates.  Often the Drop-down calendar will not register my date.  It would be preferable to have an option to type in a date.  Thank you - hoping things are running more smoothly this year.",TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Very Disappointed,It will not let me order books. Nothing shows in my cart,TRUE,Shopping Cart/Checkout
Very Satisfied,"if possible filters allowing me too look at subjects per age.  For example... fears/anxiety & age  options with 'where is my monster'.  Also maybe select value packs as alternate purchases when you select a particular book.   I found the above example after searching examples, then put it directly in to see if you had the book as an option.  After I completed my order I discovered there was a value pack with another similar book.",TRUE,Filter/Search Options
Satisfied,When searching for books to add the site often lags.,TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Very Disappointed,website is not formulated to be used with a cellphone. wouldnt even let me submit payment on my cellphone i had to use a desktop computer.,TRUE,Mobile Compatibility
Neutral,"I put items in my cart, but the site would not let me log in so I could buy the books I wanted to purchase. I had an account last year and my grandson s now in first grade, so i need to chanfge classrooms, which i did, but then I could not log in. I tried to create a new account, but could not do that either. I am not impressed with your website a the moment.",TRUE,Shopping Cart/Checkout

Satisfied,I tried to pull up the2nd & 4th grade flyers to view. they never came up even after I clicked the help if  having trouble,TRUE,Digital Flyer
Very Satisfied,The digital flyer wouldn't always come up,TRUE,Digital Flyer
Satisfied,It would be great if you could search by lexile/reading level.  Or even if you could easily access flyers from other grades as my child is reading above her grade level.,TRUE,Filter/Search Options
Satisfied,It was hard to get to the flyers but overall it was a good visit!,TRUE,Digital Flyer
Satisfied,"Not difficulties per se, but the website doesn't always feel intuitive for figuring out how to do what I need as a teacher. This is only my second year, so maybe that's why.",TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Very Satisfied,"I couldn't remember my password but if I had known the ""requirements"" I would've been able to remember it.  Maybe it would be helpful to know how many characters the passwords are?",TRUE,Logged Out/Repeat Log Ins/Password Help
Satisfied,"It can be hard to find books even with the search feature.  For instance I typed in ""Babysitters Club"" and it only offered me the 5 book pack, but I knew there was an individual book available.",TRUE,Filter/Search Options
Very Disappointed,Unable to get to the Cary to purchase.,TRUE,Shopping Cart/Checkout
Very Satisfied,Is there a better way to search for all non-book items that are available to purchase? My middle schooler likes the posters and other items that are usually available during the book fairs. I was unable to locate any of those items during my search.,TRUE,Filter/Search Options
Very Satisfied,It sent me straight to the survey before I could order. I will do so now.,TRUE,Survey Pop Up
Satisfied,the flyers are glitchy,TRUE,Digital Flyer
Satisfied,I had a hard time trying to change my password.,TRUE,Logged Out/Repeat Log Ins/Password Help
Disappointed,"I am unable to find books via searching. I searched for the title  ""Marcus Makes a Movie"" and the author ""Kevin Hart,"" among others and the books in your flyer did not come up. I used to work in a library so I know how to search books. I was able to use the item number, but it's absurd that using the titles of the book does not work. I am very disappointed with how poor your site operates.",TRUE,Filter/Search Options
Satisfied,Sometimes the digital flyers would not load and I would have to keep refreshing the page. Other than that I am a big Scholastic fan and love ordering books!,TRUE,Digital Flyer
Neutral,difficult to figure out where to make changes to account.  Site not clear.,TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Satisfied,"I like being able to see tons and tons of books, but I wish there was an option to search based on price and not by grade or age. I really like the selection of suggested books at the bottom of the page after you click on a book. I feel like there are so many books I am missing and struggle to be able to search appropriately on my phone.",TRUE,Filter/Search Options

Very Disappointed,This website is goddawful. I can’t figure out how to make an order and your tutorial only shows me how to send reminders and links to friends and family. I’ve been here ten minutes and I can’t figure it out. Fix your website. It sucks.,TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation
