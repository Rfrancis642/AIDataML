4,"Most recent book order has only been partially fulfilled, and website only shows the part received. Want to confirm the rest of the order is on its way.  Will check back in a couple days.",,
3,easy process!,,
4,Just typing in Scholastic books into the Google search always wants to default me to the teacher or main site page. I have to go to a past email of a receipt to find my way back to the parent log in and search. It would be nice to have a easier landing page for parents and families.  Outside of that - it would be nice if there was a circular that showed some of the book sets that may be having a sale or even just letting you know you have a set option. Thank you for listening.,,
3,I don't understand why when i first ordered the books. The money was removed from my account. Then a couple days ago it was returned to my account.  And now today it was sent to be withdrawled again. It didnt go through because my card is locked. I have to unlock it when a transaction is being made. Can someone call me so I can get re billed. 562.380.5835,,
5,QUICK AND EASY - GOOD BOOK SELECTION,,
5,I wish you would offer hardback books to the teachers.,,
3,"Website states code READS for free book with $25 order, but when typed in it says the code has expired. Iâ€™d like some help resolving this please. Thank you!",,
5,"Very user friendly! After typing in the item number it would be great if hitting ""return"" would do the search, and I didn't have to click on the ""submit"" button. But that's being picky...really a great site!!",,
3,"First time user. Super quick and easy to create an account, find my student's class, & submit the order!!",,
3,"I have experienced difficulties in the past however, not today.  It was very easy for both of my kids' orders.",,
5,I grew up on scholastics.  Now working at a school I see 1st hand how excited the children are when they have a school sale.,,
4,I had a little trouble with the READS $5.00 free book. I thought it would apply to one that I had already put in my cart.,,
3,"Always thrilled with Scholastic before 2020 - great deals and bonus, quick turnaround and rarely out of books. Things clearly have not recovered - the benefits and bonus are so low especially to those of us with low income classrooms, and then waiting weeks for books, its very disappointing",,
3,Site is hard to navigate.,,
5,"Would be nice to see some of the content in some of the books to make sure it is at the level our grandson is reading at currently. Otherwise, this makes it easy to buy books for gifts for good work and good grades.",,
4,I'm glad I got email when my parents placed an order.,,
5,Very easy to navigate.,,
4,"I was short 5 bonus points and couldn't figure out how to pay for the 5 I was short.  It's ok, I saved it for another day.",,
3,I put in for the free book but it doesnt seem to register in the order.,,
5,Everything worked correctly and was easy to use.,,
5,Easy to navigate.,,
5,Love how easy this was to do!!,,
3,search and able to add to card feature is nice to have.,,
4,Would like to see more books shown for selections.,,
4,The book variety is scarce for fun fantasy things and more aimed at serious world problems and obstacles. I wanted fun books for my kids derived around their favorite shows and there wasn't the selection that was there when I was a kid with all of the cartoons we watched on tv.,,
5,Had to call asking if I needed to send in order form if I already placed it online - stub said I needed to include it in payment envelope.,,
5,"I really like the ease of finding books by different criteria. I like the recommendations. I like the wish lists and teacher wish lists. I like that the reading levels can be shown by the users preference. I like the option to see books in a bundle and whether they are sold separately and pricing. I like the option to see which child (and classroom) the  order is going to at checkout, and the ease of making adjustments. I like that more books can be added even after a discount code (READS) is added. Very user friendly. Thank you.",,
4,I loved that I could copy and paste the information into ClassTag for my parents.,,
3,"The $5 free book if you spend more than $25 is a very generous offer. I do wish it were possible to view a gallery of $5 books in the pop-up that asks you to select the free book. We needed to navigate out of the pop-up to the homepage (where thankfully you had a ""$5 and under"" category) to pick out the book and then re-enter the checkout process and resubmit the READS code to select the book.",,
1,unable to access ewallet/. difficult to navigate,,
5,It'd be nice to pick any book for the free book with the coupon.,,
3,I wanted to sign up for paper copies of order forms for my students. I do not want online ordering.,,
5,I had some questions on an order that arrived today.  The chat worked great and Kindra was very helpful.  Thank you for all you do for educators and families!,,
3,Digital flyers not working well,,
4,I do not like how the 1 dollar book store is not available unless a certain amount is purchased. It was so helpful for teachers to have access to that always.,,
5,Couldn't update my credit card info until I realized I hadn't chosen a shipping address.  duh,,
5,Absolutely love Scholastic!!,,
5,I LOVE ALL THE REWARDS TEACHERS GET FOR THEIR CLASSROOM WHEN PARENTS AND TEACHERS BOTH PURCHASE BOOKS!,,
5,Easy to use and browse different books,,
4,I wish you have better offers for the free pack of 5 books. It almost seems like it's just things that are not selling that you are trying to get rid of. I'd like to  seem a more diverse offering in the free book packages.,,
5,"This is my first time on this book site.  I wanted to have some books to read to my grandson.    Even though he is handicapped, I know he'll enjoy having Grandma read to him.",,
5,I love Scholastic book club,,
5,Viewing Digital fliers,,
4,It was very slow.,,
4,"I found out that I had $10 in free books, but didn't realize that I would have the opportunity to select them before check out.",,
2,Set up new account and now site won't let me in. Many problems with Scholastic as educator.,,
3,Iâ€™m not able to create an account.,,
5,good site,,
4,I have noticed that the price of books on the flyers has increased. I love that Scholastic has kept prices low for families. I hope that the cost doesn't continue to increase.,,
5,Teacher information is not correct on Scholastic site.  Teacher has called Scholastic and CS was very rude and did not help with issue.,,
1,"Awful awful awful website. No where can I create an ewallet once logged in. There's no way to navigate from clubs.scholastic.com over to accounts.scholastic.com and back. Chat support gas lighted me and tried to tell me it was my fault, that I wasn't clicking the right things, but when I asked them where this 'Printer' icon they told me to locate they had no idea what page it was on or how to get there. Supports answer was to go find the link from my school and click on that again, why would I do that when I'm already logged into the site? Clicking 'Scholastic' in the top left takes me to yet another useless page. I'll take my business over to Amazon.",,
4,I love the Scholastic Book Clubs and remember them as a child. Reading was such a fun time in my home and I hope to share this with my students.,,
5,I cannot find my access code log in information.,,
3,Search parameters need to be expanded,,
5,"It was a good experience, as always. I enjoyed the free book code as well.",,
3,Great book selections!!,,
1,I highly dislike the fact we can NOT share our child's wish list with family members that would like to purchase books,,
3,"The site is too busy. I am looking to see why I received Scholastic Story Works, but I can't find any information about it.",,
4,Having to log in frequently.,,
5,Awesome and quick!,,
4,entered through my magazine acct and it didn't let me get to  my book orders through Club Leo,,
4,I think it would be helpful to make the reading level more obvious on the books so you don't have to open each one.,,
4,A structure closely resembling the flyer would be easier to make the purchases- or more of an open structure,,
3,"I received my box with my order today. However, The paper inside that said which books went to which student only had half of my student orders on it. I looked for a second page, but there was not one in the box. Luckily, I had printed out a copy of the order and was able to consult that. But if not, I would have had a big problem.    Also, one of the books my student ordered was not in the box. The parent had reported they got some money refunded, so I'm guessing the book wasn't available, but that would have been nice of Scholastic to let us know.",,
5,Love Scholastic! I hope shipping is better this year.,,
3,I would love to see more of a Spanish selection. I teach students in Spanish and have struggled with finding new options for my classroom library.,,
5,"An order summary was not sent with my order.  I needed to log into the site to  look up my order to distribute to my class.  Is this how you will send the order? If yes, I'll know for next time.  :)",,
3,"I wanted the phone number to see if I could stop an order in order to add more  BUT when I clicked  "" call us"" it says: to send a number from here to your android phone, sign in to chrome on both devices. I had to get out of my account and google your phone number",,
5,I just wish there were less books with anthropomorphic animals.,,
3,"I love scholastic from when i was a kid. Honestly , the site is a little clunky to use. And when I click on the book to see more, the description that I can see in teh digital flyer is gone, which is usually what i want to see more about. That could really help",,
4,Detailed explanation about the books is a plus.,,
4,Would be nice to see reviews while looking through the various options,,
5,Love this site!,,
5,"I've always looked Scholastic books since I was a child, and love that I can pass that on to my son!",,
5,"Love it, thanks!",,
5,The website is very user friendly and I was able to find and browse books specifically for my child's age and grade.,,
2,I have an email stating that I have a student order but I cannot find the order in my cart.,,
5,N/A,,
5,everything looks awesome!,,
5,Site is very easy to use!,,
5,I love that our teachers/classrooms benefit from the books we purchase!,,
4,"The READS coupon did not want to work with one of the orders but she gave me a different code that did the same thing, so it all worked out.",,
5,good book,,
3,"love the flyers and suggestions for the ages. I love the illustration used in the scholastic books better than Usborn books, to be honest. I remember this band of books when I was in school. Thanks for always being there for children literacy.  )",,
2,Having difficulty adding my free book using my iphone.  Screen wouldn't let me choose a book or would freeze when I tried to confirm my selection.  Clicking would bounce me all over your site--pretty frustrating.  Had to log on to my PC to complete my order.,,
5,Just ordering a paper catalog for my second graders.,,
5,site is very easy to use and very good selection of books updated with todays kids cartoons and characters,,
5,I have a parent who gave me a check ppayable to scholastic  for $25 How do I submit it to you  so that I still get the credit for her order.  I added it to the tab for paper orders but I am not sure what to do next.,,
5,Thank you for everything!,,
5,Logging in,,
5,"The only thing I didn't like was I was searching for a book, Three Keys by Kelly Yang, and couldn't buy it individually, had to buy the set and we didn't need all three books, so I went to amazon to buy the individual book.  Bought two other books.",,
3,Need more AR older book selection,,
5,Awesome,,
5,Lots of bonus points. Loveit!,,
4,"It was clear that I could order $10 in books however, I didn't know it would be addressed on the next page of check out.",,
4,"Not happy that my account says I owe money when I paid at time of check out, and the money is pending with my bank/card! Why is this?",,
4,I wish there were still $1.00 books available.,,
3,Need more book filters. As in series or book packs.,,
4,Had difficulties with the question marks they pertained to last year's final order.,,
3,I want $1 books  back!!!,,
4,Figuring out how to enter the classroom code that the teacher provided,,
5,All Good!!!,,
3,It would be nice if the teacher could select books that she recommends for her students.,,
4,A student ordered Diary of a Pug #1-4 (#15G1) and it couldn't be ordered to come when it is back in stock,,
3,Easy to use. Love that website matches flyer.,,
5,"I have ordered the Scholastic Books for my daughter, grandchildren, and now for my great-grandchildren. It is a great way to order books for them.",,
5,Easy to navigate and user friendly site.,,
4,I wish they still offered the 10 pack books for $10 as well as giving you the .50 off when you ordered online. For teachers who spend their own money on books for their students this is very beneficial.,,
3,Finding the e-wallet was not easy. This is my 5th year doing this and every year is difficult. Plus every time I select anything a new page automatically pops up. At the end of updating 2 kids wallets there were 10+ pages opened.,,
5,Site is easy to follow,,
5,Love scholastic and the fact parents can place their orders online!!!!,,
4,"I didn't notice the promo code until after I ordered, that was annoying.",,
5,Surprised to see an unpaid balance,,
4,Couldn't view the digital flyer,,
5,"I love the Scholastic Book Club site! I recommend it to all me teacher friends.  I do wish there were more $1 options like their used to be because I can't buy as many books for my students as I used to. I know the dollar store opens after a big order, but I usually don't have the money to do a big order and then shop in the dollar store after that.  I work at a Title I school so there is not many parents who will place an order or put money towards the initial order so that I can shop the dollar store.  But, other than that, I love it!",,
4,I would like to click multiple formats at once instead of having to go back to the filter and click again and again.,,
2,"This was my second order and I thought, based on total dollars spent and the information presented, that the order qualified for $10 free books and a free group of books. I continued to choose the $10 in free books only to be charged the $10. After going back to the beginning several times, I realized I should read the small print that said the freebies were only once between August and September. If a teacher already utilized this freebie, it should not pop up and give an alert about this reward. Little hurdles like this when ordering seem to frustrate teachers. Make order user friendly please.",,
3,"Website is glitchy and slow. It froze up. Also the pop-up  windows in the middle of the page are cut off on the screen and do not allow you to scroll down, (for example this survey) I had to tab down. This website needs a lot of work.",,
1,"I am ordering $30 worth of books, the coupon ""READS"" still shows in the banner and I can not apply y free book.",,
5,It is so easy to use this site.  I love that all of my points from the different book order forms can be combined!,,
5,"I haven't ordered yet, but I did add to my cart.",,
3,the site is not all that easy to navigate unless you are trying to view a catalog or know the name of the book you are looking for,,
5,So easy that I didn't even need to watch the tutorial. Thank you!,,
5,"I couldnt pay with my international card, or my international paypal",,
4,I tried to find a book with a general description.  I was looking for a wipe-off book for help with the alphabet and numbers.,,
3,I think that it should be noted that teachers should wait to enter in all their students orders at once otherwise we loose bonus points.,,
4,Flyer wouldn't load and clicking link still didn't work,,
1,"The site is very confusing to me.  It says it's the class page but it's hard to tell if the teacher has picked out books for the class or what.  Also, there is just too much going on on the page, it's hard to know where to go, which section to look in, etc.",,
2,Took forever to find the spot to enter my child's classroom code. Almost gave up and didn't order anything.,,
3,I did not see my ewallet for the fair tomorrow,,
5,I entered the code for a free book but it didn't take anything off of the amount of my order.,,
4,Don't know where to find the book listed?,,
5,N/A,,
5,Reasonable prices - great selection - and bonus points that help keep our classroom library stocked with high interest books.  Thank you!,,
3,It takes time to find the interesting books we want to order.,,

5,I love books!  They make great gifts!,,
3,more coupons  gets very expensive,,
5,I want to get back to Scholastic Book Clubs to help my students build their reading skills. I look forward to recving  the order forms.,,
5,Fair prices.,,
1,The search is useless.,,
5,had a difficult time looking for the class wishlist.,,
4,Just checking out availability of some titles before I make purchase soon,,
2,Make easier format to log in,,
5,easy to find the books we selected from the flyer,,
5,"I found some good books to order today, but I'm surprised by how the flyer is shrinking.  I'm not sure if it's smaller to include more books on a page, or if the selection is shrinking.  I hope that you continue to include quality books and a good selection each month.  I'd be really disappointed if your selection diminished.",,
4,Everything worked well.,,
4,"Not many parents are ordering books anymore.  I used to have huge book orders in the past.  Since my class didn't order 25 dollars worth, I missed out on the great coupon offers.  I don't want to add my own money to orders in order to get 10 dollars free.  Possibly add a 5 dollars free to the classroom that is under the 25 dollar mark.",,
5,"Your website it incredibly user friendly, easy to navigate and the deals are great!",,
4,It would be helpful to be able to search by price. I would like to have more classic titles.,,
3,Need new books.   Seems like the same stuff from last year.,,
5,"I had to link my kiddo's new teacher and it was super easy! Thanks, Scholastic!",,
3,I wish there were more hard cover books.,,
1,"Options to pay previous account balances online, not via telephone for ALL. Offer National Geographic novels in higher levels.",,
4,Its a good store like amazon and for school and the books are cheep,,
1,"Good lord, where do I put the class code in?  This is ridiculous.",,
3,I found the books i want to order and i love the weekly $1 book.  i intend on placing my order on friday,,
4,I would love to get more Spanish Scholastic order forms for my class since it is a Bilingual/ Dual Immersion class. Thank you!,,
2,I USED to teach... now I'm a grandparent and just want to order books for my grandchild... the website keeps going back to my teacher account.  FRUSTRATING!,,
5,Easy to navigate and search for what I was looking for,,
4,"I had to re-load the page and log in 3 times before the teacher information became available to me. It did not show that I was a teacher with orders waiting. It kept showing an empty cart. In the end, using the same log in that I had used twice before, it finally showed my teacher information and allowed me to order.   Having said that, I still LOVE Scholastic.  You have been a mainstay of my classroom for so many years - I don't know what I'd do without you. 3",,
4,Couldnt find an individual book to order. It was in books of 10s.,,
5,Easy to order!,,
5,"Some of the item #'s on the catalog page didn't match the online #'s. No big deal though, I searched by name and got them quickly.",,
3,Unable to find teacher resources I've used in the past to promote scholastic book clubs in my class. I don't see a ready made letter to send home or labels from front of flyers.,,
3,Super easy to navigate and find what I needed!,,
3,Last year it took forever to get the books that is why I gave it a 6.  Faster to go to a bookstore or library.  however pre-covid I would have given a 10 as books were delivered FAST,,
5,Site is easy to use/navigate.,,
3,Trying to look at prices to get an estimate for a book fair.,,
5,I was just adding a student order today and doing a little classroom shopping.,,

2,VERINT TEST,,
5,I am eager to get back to book orders after supply chain delays.,,
5,Codes did not match my pamphlet,,
4,"Good site, only slightly confusing part is ""oh wait I have to assign a student before I can buy"" but  it makes sense.",,
3,"It's not clear on your website for orders paid by check whether or not to include the paper order form.  Also, the Business Reply envelopes I'm sent with our flyer have the Scholastic Book Clubs' zip code as 45273-8504  The zip code on your website is different: 45263-0446 ... please correct.    ALSO ... why haven't we  received our regular paper flyers for October's order?",,
4,I started out on the Scholastic page and it took me a while to realize I need the Book Clubs page.,,
2,cannot find where to add my child's class code to my account,,
2,"I tried to submit my order yesterday.  When I clicked ""Submit Order"", it brought me back to the shopping cart but did not tell my why.  I tried multiple times, from different devices and it still wasn't working.  I then contacted costumer support via chat and the same thing was happening to that person.  She told me she'd put in a work order but I may not hear back for 2-3 days.  I decided to try again today and it did work.  This time, it gave me an error message in my cart telling me one of my items was out of stock.  I wish this error popped up yesterday so that I didn't have to spend my entire plan time trying to problem solve without luck.  Thankfully today it did work.",,
2,Im disappointed in the selection of books for $1 or $2.  A book for $1 popped up on my screen but it took me to a completely different section by that author. Not what I wanted.    Last year was a nightmare with Scholastic.  I'm praying its not like that again.,,
4,I wish it was easier to use bonus points.,,
5,I look forward to coming back as a classroom teacher. :),,
3,I am unable to figure out how to submit an order.,,
4,I would say not a huge difficulty but I had to reset my password and felt like I had to log in multiple times (2 or 3?) to complete the order. Not a huge problem but slightly annoying.,,
5,Always user-friendly. I did not place an order today but will very soon!,,
4,search engine could use some improvement,,
4,I was surprised by the price of the books!  Yikes!,,
4,Accidentally chose wrong school and had to start over.,,
5,"We love Scholastic Book Orders!  I ordered from the book orders as a child and it is so great to be able to order for my kids.  Thank you, Scholastic, for your commitment to getting books in the hands and classrooms of our children generation after generation.",,
5,Its amazing absoutely love it for my child,,
3,Book fair is tomorrow and my son's school does not come up.  I want to get him an eWallet but your system will not allow it without a book fair to tie it to...,,
3,Won't let me continue to check out!,,
5,Shipping is wonderful this new school year in the Fall.  Seems like the bugs are worked out.,,
3,multiple sign-ins because I was not being recognized as being signed in. I tried signing in on 3 different platforms before I could be confirmed as signed in.,,
5,I liked the questionnaire option that helped me choose a book for my child.,,
5,Easy,,
2,Very slow to load sign-in pages,,
4,"so so difficulty. It would be nice if when entering the free $5 book code, it would change the $5 book already on your order into the free book, rather than requiring you to enter the free book again and deleting the $5 book on your order.",,
5,I am not sure how to email parents directly from scholastic,,
5,Smooth and easy to use,,
4,"I wish the digital flyers were just a webpage.  The flyers behave weirdly and I kept finding myself places I hadn't intended to be.  Also, they are very small and hard to read.",,

1,Navigating the mobile site is difficult,,
5,Was trying to find the $1 books to give out as gifts for my students and my daughter's class.,,
2,Scholastic has not been helpful......we are stilled owed books from last school year.,,
3,"I like to view the flyers because it is easier to pick out titles I might be interested in purchasing.  The site was having issues and the flyers weren't coming up to view.  It was frustrating so I gave up and will try again later.  Also, I know inflation is causing everything to go up, but it is disappointing to see the once $1 books in each grade level flyer continues to go up.  I work at a Title I school and it is nice to see books that ALL kids can afford.  I usually purchase a large number of these deal books to give away in my library each month.  Now that chapter books cost $3+ I will not be able to purchase as many to give away.  I understand Scholastic is a business, but it is a little disappointing.",,
3,make it easier to post a link so friends and family can buy my child books,,
3,I could not find the sheet or a sheet to send home as a parent letter with my teacher code on it. None of the paper flyers had a sales sheet attached.,,
4,it wouldn't let me sign in,,
3,"We enjoy ordering books from Scholastic but the wording of this survey has me wondering if anyone actually read through this before publishing it. The three Yes/No questions explain that you should answer Yes if your answer is No and No if your answer is Yes. I was unable to complete my task, was unable to submit an order and did experience difficulties. Based on the survey instructions, I have selected the opposite answers for each question.",,
3,The link sent buy my son's teacher (www.scholastic.com/parentordering) didn't work and it took me a while to figure out how to get his classroom code in to properly place the order.,,
2,I have not been able to intentionally get to a place to input the code from my flyer,,
5,Love the books. Love the service.,,
1,still can not find where the editable flier is to send home,,
3,This was a great experience and so easy to use.,,

3,Letter to parents downloaded blank.,,
5,Love shopping for books for my class.  Easy website to use.,,
4,Couldn't figure out how to order the free book,,
4,"When selecting my free $10.00 credit, it would be nice if I could limit my search  with a specific dollar amount. It would save a lot of time.  Thank you for your consideration.",,

5,Thank you for having Live Chat available.,,
5,Nice to see everything is running smooth,,
3,"We LOVE scholastic, that was one of my favorite parts of teaching was ordering books. i miss the $1 books but i understand the price of inflation.",,
4,"Easy to add items to wish list and cart. Sometimes navigation is difficult (e.g., once get to checkout, it would be nice to have a back button ('back to shopping'), rather than using the browser back button or having to go back 'home' and navigate back to where I was before entering checkout).",,
4,Trying to edit my order since this teacher is no longer at Pikeside Pre-K in Martinsburg WV on Winchester avenue and it won't let me.,,
4,Just a low stock issue for one book the child wanted. I think you should take low stock out if we can't order them.,,
4,My students really like the paper flyers but we have not received any this school year.  Will they be sent in the future?,,
3,"I really appreciate the opportunity to help our teachers in the classroom while also finding new books and other products for my kids, often at prices much better than through other sellers and/or available before they are available elsewhere.",,
5,Thank you!,,
3,Well built site that is very user friendly... Thank you!!,,
3,"I had trouble finding where to submit my childâ€™s teacher & when I found it, my entire cart was deleted so I had to start over. It would be better if the scholastic site worked seamlessly with the school classroom pages.",,
5,I don't like the online necessity of paying sales tax on book purchases.,,
2,It will not add to my cart at all and I can't order.    I have a credit that I can't use.,,
4,I used the LIVE CHAT feature for the first time.  Amanda was VERY helpful and was able to clear up my problem very quickly.  Much appreciated.,,
5,Thank you,,
3,Please get more classic chapter books!,,
5,"I have loved scholastic since I was a child, and love it even more now as an educator.",,
5,Website very user friendly.,,
3,I have an account but do not know how to enter class code,,
4,I couldn't send the order to the other teacher.  I have two kids in the school.,,
5,Love your books and the prices.,,
5,first time ordering super easy and fast.,,
5,Ordered 2 Lego Ninjago Activity book.  Mrs Gugg9sbergm sent only one home.  Sending note to teacher tomorrow.  Thanks,,
3,"Site was super easy to use. The books my child circled on the flyer were easy to find and access on the site and add to the cart. Payment and checkout process was also seamless. Super easy, thank you so much.",,
3,I'm ordering for my granddaughter.  I WILL order again!,,
5,It's nice to be able to reward teachers and provide valuable reading assets to my children.,,
4,I like that the Scholastic website is easy to navigate and use. Look forward to things returning back to normal after the supply chain issues and the pandemic.,,
5,So wonderfully easy to do :) thank you,,
3,Why is tax charged for a school order?,,
4,I think there should be a way to import emails from google so that teachers don't have to manually enter them all in!,,
4,29 years with Scholastic!  It's a great investment every year! Thank you for the selection!,,
5,"Site worked great! The search function under the site search was a little confusing since it only had the ""add to cart"" button there instead of going to the item to view the descrip. I get the idea of it, just wasn't prepared for it. This is so much easier than filling out those awful newsprint, tiny order forms lol",,
5,I couldn't find one of the books that was on my granddaughter's flyer.,,
4,I wanted the option to share my child's wish list with family.,,
5,Excellent service and easy to use & navigate!,,
2,"Very frustrated-   Put $80 books in a cart, only to discover that's the ""retail side"" so I can't buy them from my son's class teacher book club.  Started over - picked $30 worth of goods, entered the READS promo code for free book and got no credit or option to pick a $5 book.  Forget it.",,
5,Everything was fine.  Looked at some products.,,
5,You guys are the best ever .,,
5,I couldn't find teacher's name. I will wait to get her class code to submit my order as I noted that purchases help teachers get free books for the classrooms. Thanks,,
4,I feel like there should be an easier search function,,
3,Searching for book in promo list,,
4,a couple books I wanted were not available as individual books and were only available as a set and we have most of the set.,,
1,My shipping and payment page does not display the payment method or information necessary to make a payment.   I spoke with a represenative last year and was under the impression that the page would be fixed.,,
5,We love scholastic books.,,
5,Great website. My daughter and I have a great time looking for books for her.,,
5,A book is out of stock.,,
5,The website is so much easier to navigate than before.,,
5,Wish there was a way to edit a letter to attach to the student flyers.      Such as fonts and size.  I can't figure that out.,,
3,Search function is not great,,
3,Had trouble going back to the $1.00 page : D,,
5,I was just giving reviews.  Love this program.,,
3,n/a,,
3,The site is not easy to navigate.  I feel like you have to click around a lot to find the best deals for teachers.,,
3,"I find the site has not been updated in 3 years, since I was last in the classroom. It is not the most user-friendly to maneuver in between the teacher wish list and book selecting. I wish multiple books could be added at once instead of one at a time.     It would be nice to have received physical copies of flyers.",,
4,Just still looking for where to do this. :),,
3,I did have difficulty finding my teacher.  I was wondering if you ship to homes instead?,,
5,I'm just waiting for my kids to add books to the cart before I submit my order.,,
3,I was on the main website before I realized I had to click somewhere special to get to the order with my kiddo's teacher.,,
5,"i love scholastic, the joy of getting my books in class sparked my love of reading and im happy to pass that love on to my child!",,
4,.,,
5,user friendly,,
5,Thank you for always offering books at reasonable prices!,,
3,Not an easy site to navigate and prices have gone up.,,
5,Easy peasy!,,
5,I'm so glad you're still in business!  I am thrilled that at least one student placed an order.  Sure wish it were more!,,
3,It is still not easy to quickly find what I want and switch back and forth between items.,,
3,"Your site is not easy to follow to order the books. I had to use the sheets that were sent home from the school and then search for each book using the item number. I was not impressed with the site. I would recommend the books, but I would also warn everyone about using the site.",,
4,"I have not ordered anything for 3 yrs.  I was not teaching reading.  I am again now.  So, setting up my acct.   Lost all my Bonus Points.  sad...",,
3,I liked that both children's orders were combined into one billing transaction. However both children should have had the ability to take advantage of the READ free book code. But only one child was able to select a free book.,,
5,Always an excellent experience,,
5,Really appreciate the service you offer children.,,
5,Thank you!!!,,
3,Looking for a connection to order flyers  sent to my school.  In previous years they were automatically sent to my school.  This year they  were not. I would like flyers for Early Childhood and Firefly.,,
5,"It's always pretty easy to use.  If you ever make changes I'd suggest they only be slight. It's easy to search, easy to add by code, easy checkout, etc. Totally overhauling the site without keeping that simplicity in place would be a nightmare.",,
4,I wish the discount books were for teachers who didn't have to spend $75.  It would benefit my class who are limited to ordering books due to budgets!,,
5,Do you still offer free shipping to home?,,
3,website is user friendly and easy to use.  Found what I was looking for and made my purchase. Simple and easy.,,
3,"should be able to place books in ""shopping cart"" directly from the digital flyer. The numbers on the digital flyer are too small to easily read. Should be listed when click on the book.",,
1,"I was going to order some books for my daughter per her preschool's request, as I have done countless times before, as this is for our 5th child.  I wanted to buy some Christian books in addition to secular ones.  When I typed in ""Jesus"" into the search bar, there was not one result.  I typed in ""God.""  Nothing.  If you can't have one book about Jesus, I can't buy from you and I will be sure to let all my friends know.  Interestingly there are results for search words like ""gay"" and ""transgender.""",,
4,Kept freezing on the flyer's.,,
4,"I could not print my printable teacher letter - I got a screen with ""bad response"" instead.  I opened it in an incognito window and it worked.",,
4,n/a,,
4,Out of stock items should be able to be ordered and then I can be updated when they are available and shipped.  Not telling me to check back later.,,
5,super easy to navigate,,
4,I logged in today because I didn't receive my October catalogs.  So I'm requesting them now.  I figured they would be sent out automatically each month!!!,,
3,"However,  in the drop down menu to select the teacher, the teacher's name was not listed. It would be great if we could type in the name when the name is not available to select.",,
1,when I am at checkout and have $ to use - I should be able to pull up my wish list and add those books in.  This is very frustrating.  The system really needs to be easier for teachers.  We don't have time to navigate back and forth.,,
5,very well placed categories ans recommendations. Only feedback is that when I was on a recommendation page I liked 2 books and I clicked on 1 to add to cart but after that I couldnot go back to the same recommendation page and missed the second book I had liked. I then had to search for it again.,,
4,The representative that assisted me was very helpful to complete my order.,,
3,The survey popped up before I could complete what I was doing.,,
4,Sometimes I find it hard to locate the collection deals or the book of the week sale,,
4,I am not sure that the entire process is intuitive but I am muddling through.,,
4,It would be helpful if we could see the titles of all books that are in book bundles before placing the order. I did not order the unicorn diaries bundle today because I couldn't read what titles were included.,,
3,"Thank you for my latest order, we love the books! I was told that once the order ships I would receive an e-mail and could then call to have the tax removed. That has not yet happened. I also earned $10 in free books and a multipack preschool, that were both missing from the shipment.",,
5,I love scholastic as a parent and as a teacher,,
4,Discount code did not work chat bot told me to sign off and back on which was annoying,,
4,Keep me logged in once I log in,,
4,Finding the Book Clubs for the correct codes to enter.. I feel like I switch between screens.. Scholastic regular vs after I sign in and it connects me to his class.,,
5,easy and detailed site!,,
5,"I am a grandmother and am delighted to be able to buy books for my granddaughter and her class!    I loved Scholastic books as a child, as a mom and now as a grandma.  :)",,
5,A parent wrote a check to Scholastic while the rest of the parents sent cash.  I paid for everything on my debit card.  This means I need to contact the parent who wrote a check to you and ask them to rewrite it.,,
3,The process to confirm an online order placed by a parent is overly complicated & redundant.,,
5,I am not sure that I fixed my problem.  I have not been receiving flyers this year.  I tried to update my class info again in hopes they will start coming!,,
5,Very fast and efficient. Love shopping here for my daughter! Lots of great options and pricing.,,
4,Super disappointed the shark book is out of stock.  I did not see any information as to when it might be available again.  Super sad 5 year old.,,
3,it was a pleasure to visit the website.,,
5,easy,,
4,A couple search challenges. Typed in a book I knew was there and it didn't come up.,,
4,"I would love the flyers to be sent out again. It is a great way to help those purchase books, by seeing the item.",,
3,It isn't easy to find my teacher's code so that I can order through her classroom.,,
5,students really love it when they get their books.,,
5,"I went in today to modify my profile for my new school & role. I wish there was a way that I could indicate that I am not a classroom teacher, I am a support specialist. I still order books to use with students, but I don't need you to send me class flyers.  Is there a way for me to do this?",,
5,couldn't find certain books,,
4,A little difficult to apply a coupon and use it- but I figured it out.,,
1,dogs are cute,,
5,"I find the site hard to navigate.  The collections can sometimes be helpful, but it would be nice to be able to just look through all titles at once.",,
4,"If connect to the teacher, should not require sign up process.",,
3,All were good,,
4,It timed out and did not keep what I had done. I had to re-enter everything.,,
3,"You have to know the code, or which specific teacher's name to order under and then you make an account?  Does not make any sense!  You cannot even browse through books on the flyer you were handed, that did not have a code printed on it!!!",,
2,"I struggling with ordering simply because there isn't enough variety.  I'd like to see more stable books offered instead of bandwagon books that don't last the test of time.  Also, the prices are so high parents don't even want me to bother with sending out class orders.  I always hope I'll find something for my classroom, but that is getting very hard to do anymore.",,
5,This visit to the site was to get a game plan for which books I will be purchasing within a day or so...I just didn't purchase any at this moment.,,
1,cant find teacher and no code,,
3,I am sad that there are no longer packs of 10 books for $10.  I used these packs for all students to get a free book.,,
4,I cannot print or download the parent letter.,,
5,Some of the digital flyers would not load to view.,,
5,"Wonderful bundles and prices, thank you!",,
5,I kept going to book fair vs book club. but I found my way and items,,
4,"One of the sets of books that a student wanted to order is out of stock. I will check back later. It is the Who would win, rumble 6 pack. Item number 42G1 for $22.",,
5,Great to be able to easily enter the code from the paper classroom flyer,,
4,"I had to search around to find where to enter the class code but other than that, the visit to your site was seamless.",,
4,The price used to be 50 cents less on line. Disappointed that they are the same price now.,,
5,Very easy to use.,,
4,"once i find this site it's ok.  but there are like two scholastic sites that i can't differentiate and i can't find the books on one of them, but they are almost exactly alike.  i hate that.",,
5,My students enjoy the book selection and i enjoy the ease of ordering and the digital platform.,,
5,will enter order soon - just waiting to see if my mom wants to order anything too,,
3,"I struggled with the bundled options, its not easy to see details about each book.  Picture shows 4 books when there are 5- its a bit confusing.",,
1,I s till do not know how to submit an order with money brought to me by a student that is in cash - I have to pay out of pocket up front for this?,,
4,"It would be great if teachers/parents could search by price (for example in the search bar enter ""$1"" and all the $1 books came up)",,
4,The button to SEE ALL in a section doesn't stand out easily,,
5,Easy to use and search for titles.,,
5,"Site is easy to navigate. However, I did not see the bonus catalog section. I will look when I submit order on Wednesday.  Thanks for the $1.00 book section. helps me with birthday books and holiday books.",,
4,It would be great if you had a way to sort by price or browse for books below a certain price point.,,
5,Reading gonna helps your child to be smarter.,,
5,"My only problem is the shipping fee with paper orders under $25.  I teach at a school with lower income families and very few are able to buy books, and when a couple do, then I'm left to pay the shipping which is not fully fair.",,
5,Na,,
3,Easy and straightforward,,
3,"Order links from the magazine is very quick and easy! I do not know if this is a new feature or not, but it is brilliant.",,
3,cant search for a book,,
3,I love scholastic books!,,
5,I have enjoyed Scholastic book orders since I was a child myself.  I have been ordering for 31 years as a teacher.,,
4,Would perfer a long list (with pictures) of the books you offer. Categorizing them doesn't always make things easier. I kept seeing the same 15 books. Sure there are more.,,
4,I need to make my status inactive.  I do not need any flyers right now and need to stop them from being mailed to me at my school.,,
2,The website is very difficult to navigate to find where to add funds to my childrens account for shopping at their book fair in person.  Links from the email just direct to the log in page and donâ€™t get to where you are trying to go.  It would be nice to have a feature that would provide a link for family members to fund their book shopping account as well.,,
5,Very easy to navigate. :),,
4,"I wish there was a way to search or sort by price. For example, as a parent (or a teacher) looking to build my library on a tight budget, I'd love to search for all the $5 and under books. Or knowing that Scholastic has dollar deals, all the $2 books.",,
3,I love this site. It's so convenient.,,
3,Just initial navigation is a little confusing,,
4,The way the free book code needed to be entered was a bit confusing. I ended up ordering two copies of the same book.,,
5,"I am hoping that orders will be delivered in a more timely fashion this year.  Last year, orders would take up to three weeks to process and parents were getting upset.  I am hoping there will be a faster turn around time this year.",,
3,There is always a good selection of books for any reading level.,,
4,"trying to figure out how many bonus points I have  *thank you for all the great prices, bonuses, shipping :)",,
3,great website. always a deal. love the website.,,
1,It was difficult to find the site.  I was redirected several times to other scholastic sites.  Your book selections are very political.  I just want to get my kid a story book.,,
5,I am hoping that shipping is a lot more timely this year.  I quit ordering last year(after 35 years of book ordering) because of the shipping time.  (I was embarassed in front of my class),,
3,"Three parents told me they placed an order, I dont' see it.",,
4,"My school is not the right school, even though it's the right teacher.",,
1,The page is stuck on the check out screen  Very frustrating,,
5,THANK YOU!,,
5,Came to check on student order that was shipped- wrong set of books was sent.  I will be contacting customer service again as this is the 2nd time it happened this year.,,
2,Changing teacher is a nightmare on site.,,
5,Very easy to use.,,
3,Finding my class information (i.e. when a due date is) has been a little difficult to find.,,
5,I have used Scholastic Book Clubs when I taught before and I absolutely loved the deals and freebies!,,
4,"I had a lot of problems with orders last year and was very frustrated with Scholastic.  I had a shipment get lost, a shipment go to a school I haven't taught at for 8 years, and shipping delays like crazy.",,
5,Just checking on student orders submitted online.  I will submit them on Friday.,,
5,I love scholastic book club. It has been a slow start after the pandemic but I am hoping this year will blossom with readers!    I loved your videos they were so helpful in doing the things I needed to get done!,,
5,"Kindly watch the woke content.  You have a duty to provide wholesome, unbiased literature to our children.  It's a powerful position to be in, please respect it.",,
2,It is hard to find the electronic wallet to add additional money.,,
4,I am surprised that my customer number was changed.  It was the same number for years.  Why did it change and did everything from my old account merge or do I have 2 accounts?,,
3,It's really easy to fin books in this website.,,
4,Could improve selecting free books earned when checking out by adding photos of items,,
5,Adding to wish lists so that when I can get class codes (teachers haven't been updated for this year).,,
3,"I tried on my phone to enter a free book and submit my order,but it did not work so I went on my computer and tried and it worked.",,
1,It said general error.,,
2,Very hard to find the link for parents and the school book order.,,
3,"I am truly not trying to sound negative or that I'm complaining, but your website is incredibly difficult to navigate. There are WAY to many things to look on every page that I go to. Perhaps student orders can show up as JUST their names with a drop down option if you want to see what they've ordered? I don't know... it's just really challenging every time I come to this site. Like I said, I'm NOT trying to complain... I LOVE children's books and I LOVE promoting them. I just have a really hard time on your website. Thank you",,
4,Good selection of books for children - to honor themselves and others,,
3,I can't find filters and I wanted to filter by price.,,
4,I was just checking my parent online orders. They are due by tomorrowâ€¦and I will submit together then.,,
5,I am so excited to get  books for my kids:),,
3,Very easy using code from the flyer that preschool sent home,,
5,Amazing,,
1,"PS, not buying any books on here until you provide more unifying, less divisive subject matter.",,
1,"Too much anti-American content or divisive material on here.  I could not find any material on pride in country, being a responsible American citizen, or Founding principles.  If Scholastic cannot expand its subject matter, Iâ€™d rather not receive this newsletter.     Do better.",,
2,"Very slow, site freezing.",,
4,I was unable to find the book packs listed on the cover pages of the flyers sent to me.  I wasn't sure where to find them.   It was also difficult to see the text when I was viewing sample pages.  Sometimes I was able to get it to zoom in on the words by moving my mouse over and sometimes it would not.   It was also frustrating to have to keep clicking on the see full details button to read a description of the story.,,
5,Keep up the great workd!,,
5,This site seems to work very well. I DO wish that when I chose my free $5.00 book that I would have been given the option to choose the book OR make an additional donation to the donation area. Spread even more of the love!,,
5,love the online ordering for parents    keeps it so simple,,
5,very user friendly and easy to navigate!,,
5,happy you except Paypal. Makes it very user friendly.,,
3,"I read the tutorial, but found it a little difficult to navigate the site and look at books. After I ordered I realized there were a LOT more books to choose from than I had seen. Oh well, next time. The prices are good. Not all books had a description of the story",,
4,None at this time,,
3,I couldn't find the place to select my $10 in free books :(,,
4,I hope the shipping issues are resolved.,,
5,WE LOVE YOUR BOOKS!,,
5,Ordering was fast and easy.  Thank you!,,
1,Rested an account one for each child then could not get to a place to order for youngest. I was stuck at the oldest.   Will go out and try again,,
3,I had trouble viewing the digital flyer.,,
4,Need to make sure that I will be receiving my flyers at my site this year for each month. They did not come directly to me but came in bundles with other schools from the district in it. I often missed the flyers altogether because they never arrived at our site and I would have to call scholastic to send the flyers directly to me and that took a few days for them to arrive.,,
5,Site is easy to navigate.,,
3,"Promo code did not work for the $25.00 order and get a free $5 book.  Also, it would have been nice to check out as a guest as I do not want to receive emails from Scholastic.",,
5,I liked being able to type the item number from the paper order form into the search box.,,
3,"I am unsure if I sent the email to parents. I was in the middle of adding students and I was told that my time expired. However, when entering names, I thought I could download the list but I saw that all those names came up as one student. Then, I could not delete my error so I had to continue and add students  one at a time. This involved typing name, clicking add, having to click in box again to type another name., etc. Then time expired and I do not know what students I have listed.   I did not continue because it would take more time.    I did share the SBC to 2 of our new colleagues. I hope they do not get discouraged.",,
3,Very slow to load,,
5,Very easy to order books,,
4,"The hover behavior where it opens a dialog when you're in the catalog view is a little weird, but it works.    Tried to search for ""how it's built"" books, and the search definitely seems like it could use improvement. No results for ""sailboat"" even though there's a sailboat book in there.",,
5,"Wish SBC would reinstate delivery to home, again.  It would make this book fairy's life easier, but I can work it out with the teachers.",,
4,"Below ,in this survey , you asked me if I need assistance ( which I don't ) , then my email was required regardless. Why?",,
4,Just deleting names from my contact list...it didn't transfer over nicely or communicate with google well.,,
4,One of my students did not get a book she ordered.,,
3,"I find that I often get redirected to the teacher store, when all I want is to order books through the book orders. I saw the flyers advertising a lot of 6 books for $7.00, which is so helpful for my book clubs, and I was just trying to see what other titles were offered in that same deal. It was hard to find that.",,
5,Love this program!!,,
4,"The site is pretty easy to get around on.  I do like that you tell us right away if a book is out of stock.  Then we can just let the families know, and there is not this long wait time, like last year.  Thank you!",,
4,"Just that a book was ""out of stock""",,
5,"I completed the survery before I was able to put in my order for it popped up as I was about to do the order/bonus part of the website. The survey should come up at the end, not at the start.",,
5,"I plan to submit an order today, but I'm not done shopping",,
4,"It was difficult to access the dollar books, even though I had earned them.  Also tough to gain access to the visa funds I had from last year.",,
1,was trying to find my Bonus Points #.    I  want to know IF I can transfer my balance of points to another Teacher  at a different school.  I am retiring & dont need them.,,
5,Love Scholastic!,,
4,"My daughter is in a dual language program at school.  She has half the day in spanish. I wish that the Leo flier was more often. I know it used to be almost every month. Now  (unless that has changed this year)  it is only twice a year.  I think you should market your Leo flier to teachers that are DLI. Spanish books are more expensive (in my experience) and most of my child's teachers are new since the program is new to our school.  Also, I have really noticed that the prices on everything have gone up. I suppose it is due to the state of the world, but it makes me sad.",,
5,East experience,,
3,There were so many pop ups and notifications it was hard to see where I had to go and where to enter the actual order. Please make it more user friendly. thank you,,
5,I love your site! So easy to use.,,
1,"My child is added to my teacher/school within ""My Account, My Children"" in our profile. However, no option comes up for me to ""add his name"" to each book at checkout. No matter what I try to add to my cart, when I go to the cart it's always empty w/an alert in red to assign my child to each book. Very frustrating! I've tried removing my child & adding him back to his teacher/school & that didn't work. I'm not going to create a new account because I've ordered with no issue last year. I don't want to assign a new e-mail address just to order. I've tried both on my iphone and on two computers and nothing works.",,
3,Purchasing the books I wanted was easy and quick.,,
4,I wish that you could also search for books by price.  I often have money to spend (earned rewards) and sometimes difficult to spend the exact amount.  Being able to search by price would help with this process.,,
3,I would love to be able to search books by reading level (vs. age level).,,
5,easy,,
4,it logged me out after a few minutes of inactivity but once i logged back in all my items were still in my shopping cart,,
4,sad that scholastic got rid of the 50 cents cheaper when ordering online,,
3,"I have been using Scholastic for years and I am currently having a difficult time recommending books to my kindergarten families.  The prices have increased tremendously, while the selection has decreased.  I'm hoping that you will offer most books in the $3 - $4 range with a few choices in the $2 range.  You are also offering books in packs, but not offering the titles separately.  I won't buy the pack when I already have most titles.",,
3,"Maybe I am just missing it, but I really wish I could find books by the skill level of the reader better. My son has dyslexia and isn't reading at his grade level, so it makes finding books for him on this site difficult.",,
4,I wanted to use bonus points to buy a book but the system charged instead of using the bonus points. I ended up deleting the book.  Hopefully I can order it with the bonus points next month.,,
3,a little confusing which program is which and where to go to just order and look at books,,
5,"I haven't tried to get those catalogues yet, so I'm not sure if I'll be successful.",,
5,Very easy to use site! Love how we could shop the flyer so easily!,,
4,It's not user friendly unless you are knowledgeable with the site,,
5,Love the updates made to this site. Easy to navigate and you have  created a more interesting site to peruse.,,
4,Some parts wouldn't load. It would also be nice if you could add to cart straight from the brochure page,,
5,"I love all the books you have, and very affordable.",,
3,"When my account pulls up, it pulls up to my parent account.  I want it to pull up to my teacher account.  I guess I will have to cancel the parent account because otherwise I have to try to figure out how to see student orders- it's not very user friendly.    When you pull up the flyer view, it won't let you go to the next page if you zoom in to look at anything.  You should still be able to click the arrow to turn the page even if you zoom in to see a book description instead of going all the way out and starting over.",,
4,Would like option to have a quick translated Spanish version  of the Family Letter - Could not find.  Thank you   -    The website gets improved each year - and teachers/parents really appreciate that.,,
5,I'm just pre shopping of our next book order for Christmas gift ideas.,,
4,I work in the school library and would like to have the links to several age group flyers available in the email that gets auto created.,,
3,"Some of the features on the website are a little difficult to manage on various devices--the popups (while helpful at times) often get in the way of the task at hand.  The website was very difficult to use on an iPad, but much better on a laptop.",,
4,It's hard to find the exact books on the teacher's list.,,
5,First time on the site and I love it. Will come back to the site with my wife and child to pick out a few books. Thank you.,,
5,"Worked great, as usual!",,
3,you don't save .50 on books ordering online and you have to pay tax.,,
5,Very easy to navigate.,,
3,"I would appreciate an easier way to look at the flyers...maybe in alphabetical list for with a picture of the book  beside each listing.    It would also be wonderful if there were more books available with a Christian theme, especially at Christmas and Easter.",,
2,"Historically, I find the Scholastic Book Club site very challenging to navigate",,
3,I have parents who place book orders after I have submitted the order.  It is less than 12 hours after I have done so and the parents are told their child's order will be shipped in October.  He then calls and is on the phone for over 30 minutes.  Why do you make it so difficult to place orders?  My class order is still processing so why is it even an issue?    Please email me.  I had another parent place an order a day later.  Will that order be sent with my class order?,,
1,"The site loads slowly, shows books I don't click on. The digital flyer is clever but not user-friendly. At all. A different format (maybe that looks less likely the flyer) would work better.",,
1,"The interface takes me in circles when I'm trying to find something. It has always been challenging to have a teacher and parent account simultaneously, they do not pair well together. Very frustrated that my account is under a parent and I have no way to change it to an educator. I just want flyers to send to my students and have no way to access it or request flyers.",,
4,I wish you would not charge tax (just have it already added in the book price). Also I miss getting a receipt with my order.,,
3,"It's frustrating to not be able to get the next book in a series. For example, the Wings of Fire. My daughter read the first one to see if she liked it but we don't want the set because we already have the first one. We just want the second book, but will have to get it somewhere else.  Thanks",,
5,This was the easiest and fastest website that I've ever visited and purchased from.,,
4,Didn't place the order today because the due date is next week.,,
5,"I love all the books you have, and very affordable.",,
1,"I can't add anything to my cart!  I click the black ADD TO CART button, and a pop-up says the item is added, but when I go to the cart it is empty.  This site is useless.",,
3,I am not able to find the scholastic code for families to use online to shop from my classroom,,
4,Itâ€™s difficult to swipe right and see all the books in a category.,,
5,I love Scholastic!,,
3,This book club has been around since I was a child and am glad it continues on for our child today. That is over 20 years of amazing service to bringing books into our home. Thank you,,
1,"Every time I add a book to cart, I get a pop-up that says added to cart, but then the cart is still empty.",,
4,It just took me a while to find the dollar section that was available to me.  I hope that the books do not take as long as last year to arrive!,,
2,"I can't find two students who placed an order.  My cart is empty, but it says I have two students who ordered.  I really hope this isn't a repeat of last year when I waited from Sept. to the end of Nov. for my first book order....",,
5,Thank you,,
4,the books are more expensive than Amazon,,
5,Easy to do!,,
2,"I am a sub trying to place an order under the teachers name, however I couldn't do that successfully so I used my account from prior teaching.  So much hassle.",,
5,Everything was easy to navigate!  Thank you!,,
5,Easy clicks! Excellent! Rate A++++,,
4,It would be nice to shop by flyer without having to download every flyer,,
4,"The website (and this could be operator error) would get stuck as I was trying to place the orders.  It would not let me scroll down the list of the catelog to check certain books.  I had to refresh and then it let me scroll down.  Otherwise, I like the option of being able to look at the flyer and having items shipped to my home so that they are not lost at the school. or if we need to go virtual with the pandemic.  Thank you for making these changes.  I have always loved Scholastic book club.",,
2,How do I enroll children with different teachers? I tried to a child to my account but was not asked for the teacher code.  I could not figure how to see a classroom wishlist,,
5,Love the online option - so easy and fast!  Thank you!,,
5,Great site!,,
5,"Was a little overwhelming to sort through the flyers and try to present options to my kindergartner, but got it done!",,
5,Much easier to use this year.,,
1,Congratulations- my new password for this site contains the words This is stupid.  I have been a parent ordering books for almost 10 years and the absolutely ridiculous crap I had to go through to log back in after forgetting my password was exceedingly frustrating.  What a waste of my time.  Next time I will go to the bookstore or library to get my kidsâ€™ books.  The drive will take less time.  I couldnâ€™t even complete my order before this stupid survey popped up.,,
5,I love being able to submit my child's order and pay for it online and have it shipped  to his classroom teacher!!,,
5,"Wish entire book orders could arrive at the same time. I get partial orders for some kids, and itâ€™s hard to send fulfilled orders home with just some kids, and partial orders with others. I try to keep partial orders until I have all their books, but have to refer to the order history online to see if their order is complete or if there are more coming.  Takes a bit more time to,cross check the orders.",,
4,"Still getting used to using the online, but I was not able to get back to the teachers list after I chose some books. Not sure if that's a user issue but I wish there was a visible tab to get back to that after making selections and checking my cart to see what my total was at. my intention was to spend 25 and then spend the $5 on a book for the teacher and I could figure out where her requests were.",,
5,very easy and user friendly,,
5,"I appreciate the opportunity to offer my students a variety of books to purchase.  I would like to see ""small group"" sets of books for my new grade level to purchase.",,
3,"After selecting a book description, it's difficult to get back to the page where you can select a different flyer.    I would prefer more individual books instead of a pack of several.",,
3,I wanted to see more books beyond my child's grade.  The options were confusing to figure out and looked like that same books over and over again.,,
5,Having the paper order form from the teacher makes searching for books and putting in order quick and easy!,,
2,"After my order as a parent, the email gave me a link to check the status of my order.   However, I an unable to find anywhere on this site where I can do that!",,
2,"First, what the heck is the difference between a book fair and a book store? Why does it still look like I'm benefiting my niece's old school from past years, when I tried to sign up with my daughter's new school? Your flyers stopped loading for me after I'd looked at several. The cart doesn't have an easily visible total... I have to scroll all the way to the bottom, which feels like extra work when I just want to know where things stand before I add more books (or subtract some).",,
4,I couldn't add the free book from the mobile site it wouldn't let me scroll down to submit.  So i had to pull it up on my laptop to get the free book saved.,,
4,"Last year when the orders arrived, each child's order was printed on a tear apart slip. This made it easy and efficient to sort large orders and ensure that all of the correct books were sent with each child. We also were able to send this slip with the books as a receipt showing the parent that they had received all we have record of them ordering,    This order I received had three pages of books listed and some of the student orders were in different places on different pages,    If possible, the tear apart slips or a place online to reference the orders would be great!  Thanks for all you do,  Melanie Coffelt",,
4,Wondered what to do about out of stock orders.  I plan to return the student's money,,
4,"I entered the code on the header (READS), but when I tried to check out it says the code has expired.",,
5,I absolutely love this company. I know that last year you had difficulties that were outside your reach. But this year I've already placed one order and received it in record time. Keep up the great job.,,
4,"I like the books available. I like that you can find books by age, grade and level.",,
2,"Signing in to do book fairs vs bookclubs and then being a teacher in one school, having two kids in another, another kid in another, and then being the Book Fair chair for a different school. It's so difficult! I've already messaged for assistance.",,
5,Just checking up on my class order which is due later this week.,,
3,"Even after typing in the title of the book that I was looking for, the site took a long time to find the item.",,
5,Website is easy to use.,,
4,"The book that I wanted to order is out of stock.  No details as to when it will be back in stock.  Usually, companies would send you information when the item is back in stock.  Disappointed.",,
4,unsure how to submit student paper order with ease. Also thought it was silly there is a shipping limit. Should be free shipping for all,,
4,"I don't see many books on the home page of the website.  For overall browsing purposes, I prefer to flooded with options as a consumer.",,
3,very smooth website for a technologically challenged individual such as myself.,,
3,"the promotion code,advertised all over the site is not working",,
5,Would not let me enter free book selection on a $176.00 order.,,
1,"If you are going to advertise a promotion like READS, you should take it down if it's no longer available, which is the message that appears in my cart when I am ordering well over the required amount.   You're being very misleading in your advertising.   But for supporting our teacher through the promotion you are giving to teachers whose parents place orders before September 30th, this experience makes me not want to shop from Scholastic again.",,
1,This was such a terrible experience.  What books come in the five book bonus pack? How do you pay for the dollar books?  How does the teacher  purchase books for the classroom from the flyer?  What are thee bonus points for? If I send you the paper order how do I know who gets what? Come on scholastic- make it stress free for the teacher too!,,
5,Looking forward to ordering book for this school year.,,
4,I love that the teachers get a book for the class!,,
4,The page was slow to load. Not sure if it was the website or my computer though.,,
5,I found a book to add to the wish list. I will likely order it when I make my next book order.,,
3,"Some book bundling deals are awkward and too pricey. Overall, the inventory sometimes feels limited on this site.",,
5,would like to see individual book options if they are also in a pack: otherwise we end up with duplicates. thanks!,,
3,Hard to search for books.,,
3,Sometimes the site is confusing to navigate between the clubs and regular inventory.,,
5,Representative was very helpful in checking my account to be sure it was still active,,
4,I would love to see Reading Group Book sets for lower GRL levels A-D.,,
3,"i searched the graphic novel of i survived the attacks of september 11, 2001 and nothing came up",,
5,I will most likely submit an order this month. The only reason I didn't do it today is because I am waiting for my class due date before I submit.,,
5,"My class and I love Scholastic Book Clubs! I know shipping was a nightmare during covid but I ordered many books last year for my class and parents and I both had an easy time doing so. The books eventually got to us :) I hope this year is a bit quicker with shipping. I really encourage my parents to utilize these cheap prices. I call it BOOK DAY when our orders come in and I get books for everyone so no one feels left out. Each month it is a BIG deal to get our scholastic book orders in! Thank you!    Nicole Jones  First Grade Teacher  Hampton, NJ  UTES",,
5,super easy to find books and place order,,
4,"Since the pandemic, I have not been getting the student flyers sent to school.  I REALLY want them to generate more orders.  PLEASE send them to school.  I emailed last year and sat on hold for a time to talk to a Rep about this and still have not received the paper flyers.",,
4,"I'd love Free shipping, or some bonus to get free shipping.  I can't control whether many of my students order books or not.  With a $25 minimum, I have to send the book orders home less often to be sure more kids order books, so that I don't have to pay for shipping.  I'm just not willing to spend my money to pay shipping for my students' books.    Maybe there could be a minimum order amount for individual families to order and have it sent to school or home??",,
5,I placed an order for my class yesterday 9/16/2022 by phone. I did not have any online orders. However a student placed an on line order this morning so I placed this order today. It was very easy to place this on line order.,,
5,It was very easy to place my order today on line.,,
5,NA,,
5,Pretty slick being able to add in the item number from the book order to add to my cart! Did not have to search very far for the items I wanted to purchase!,,
3,Very difficult to navigate website and put in the information to access the flyer (and to put in the code for my daughter for new teacher) so that I could order the books that my child liked from the flyer.,,
5,"Just wondering if parents could be prompted to select a free book when their order is over $25.  I have a family that earned a free book, but didn't make a selection.  It would be nice if they could be prompted for these rewards just like teacher's have on their checkout page.",,
1,"The system would not allow me to place and order and ship to my home.  The children are in the middle of a nasty divorce, and I would like to have the books shipped to my home.  If the father receives the books, he will not return them.  Additionally, I order other items for Christmas and Birthdays, as well as for other grandchildren.  I would like those to be a surprise.  The system should allow me the option to ship to my home and pay for it.",,
2,"The links provided on the flyer didnâ€™t work. I had to search and find the site , navigation was frustrating.",,
5,Quick and easy ordering.  I like that you can add items by order number.  Reviews of items help to make purchase decisions easier.,,
3,Could not get the site to work on the Chrome browser even with cookies unblocked.,,
3,First time user -- super easy process!,,
1,Website is slow to respond and download.,,
3,Seemed hard to search for books.,,
5,"I often struggle with on-line sites and orders.  This by far was one of the easiest transactions I have encountered,  Kudos to all involved.",,
4,I couldn't locate my child's teacher class code.,,
5,I love Schoastic and so do my students!,,
5,I like being able to type the codes from the flyer and finding the books right away!,,
5,I have changed grade levels. I want to continue to improve literacy with my ELL and regular education students.,,
5,Love Scholastic Book Club since I was a child. As a teacher I am trying to show how wonderful books are and where they can buy them.,,
5,thank you..nice and eazy...,,
4,Browsing to look at the books circled from flyer will come back to complete my order later.,,
5,I couldn't complete my order because one of the student order was out of stock and I had to contact the parent to see if they wanted to change their order or get reimbursed. I used the chat feature for the first time.  I really like that feature.,,
3,The only issue was having the Feedback and Live Chat on the right side made it difficult to move up and down the page on my laptop.,,
1,signing up i did not get points or neither did the person who shared. Also the sign up was really buggy.,,
5,Much easier to order online than it is to submit orders the old fashioned way like I used to have to do when I was in school!,,
4,Free book selection should be larger,,
5,We like searching by flyer and by other lists. Thanks!,,
4,the email that is associated with my account isn't a valid email for some reason.  i could't change my forgotten password because the email isn't correct.,,
3,"There is a black rectangle on the THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER page with the word PRINT that did not print. I chatted with your rep Christopher, but he was unable to fix the problem. He said he would submit it to your tech people.",,
5,"I was trying to use the READS code for the free book for several weeks and it kept saying ""expired"" but it wasn't... Finally got it to work! Thanks for the free book.",,
3,need to change teacher so they get the credit,,
4,I want to know how to get flyers,,
5,Great way to support our teachers and enhance literacy skills!,,
4,trying to update my grade level to kindergarten so I could share the link with parents. I used the chat feature and the associate checked it for me. It was kindergarten on one screen but still said 1st on the other. Associate checked and confirmed profile on your side and suggested I clear my cache on my end.,,
3,how about some tutorial videos on how to...?,,
5,Scholastic has always been special to me and my students. Ordering is easy for my families and myself as the teacher.  We love scholastic!,,
3,"It is just not easy to find things on your website. Since I work on line, I need to be ale to quickly and easily see if  my students have made orders so that I can submit them.  That is not an easy thing to find.",,
3,"I ordered some books for my younger son because his teacher sent home a book order. So I connected him to his teacher's class. I then did the same with my older son because he wanted some books as well, but his teacher never actually gave us a book order or mentioned that she was putting one in.  I was just able to find her name in the website when I went to connect him to a teacher. Today, my younger son came home with his book order, but my older son did not. My older son's order still just says ""Submitted to teacher."" Is there something else that I need to do?",,
3,I appreciated the pop-up to add items directly to the cart from the home page.,,
4,DON'T SEE HOW TO SHARE FLYER WITH A PARENT,,
5,I like that parents can order online under the class code!!,,
1,When I click sign in a white blank box comes up and I am unable to sign in.  I can sign in at my school but not at home. I tried connecting to my hotspot- that didn't work either. Why can I not sign in at home?,,
5,Prices are too high. Not willing to pay $6-8 for a paperback book.,,
5,I love Scholastic!!,,
3,"Just hard to find something that I think she will enjoy, thats at her level. Shes 8 and a good reader but many books seem to young for her (picture books) and she doesn't enjoy graphic novels. I only want  to buy books that will get reread,  otherwise we just go to the local library  cheaper for me and less clutter at home.",,
5,Wish it would let me order for my 8th grader and just send them home or to the school.,,
4,The only difficulty is shopping or making Teacher Selections by level. I wish there was a way to search books by reading level.,,
4,I thought this was pretty straight forward. My only thing was that it took me a moment to find the button to see all books in the age group I selected rather than just a sample of what was available. Once I saw that link everything else was easy.,,
5,"My customer # has changed, and the number of spaces for my customer # is different than what is on the envelope.",,
5,"When I tried to download my Family Letter, it would not open to the letter. The site stated it was not found.",,
5,I see there is now a minimum $25 in order to receive the free shipping. There are times I have had only a couple parents order and my total amount is under this. I as a teacher would NOT want to incur the $6.50 S&H fee.,,
5,always an easy process to order books. the kids get so excited,,
4,If it is possible to look at books by theme a little easier it would be nice.,,
4,not enough books displayed on a page when looking at fiction books.  Too many pages to click through.,,
1,And whereâ€™s the pre-k or early childhood site? I tried to order but I was told by the website that I was wrong,,
4,When selecting free books it would be nice to see the covers and authors.,,
5,I retired and then came back part time and I am so excited that my new school allows Scholastic books clubs!!  Thank you!,,
5,For holidays I like to purchase my students a book such as Spookley the Square Pumpkin or Twas the Night Before Christmas.  The last few years many of these popular books are only offered in book bundles instead of individually.  Could you please also offer books individually so that we may purchase these classics for our entire class.,,
4,"There was a $1 books offer that opened to me, but when I switched pages I couldn't find it again. I was going to go back and get some but couldn't access it easily. Otherwise no problems.",,
1,Why aren't the club and teacher site connected. Very lame.,,
5,love the book variety,,
5,I love it,,
5,site is user friendly and so convenient,,
5,Hoping the delayed shipping issues of last year are no longer around! Kids always excited for books to arrive and the 6 weeks of last year was a bit long to wait!,,
1,I have just placed my last order with your company.  You failed to honor your advertised rewards for teachers when students place orders.  I'm done with your company.  My time is too valuable to do your advertising for free.  No more!  Do not send me any more flyers.  I am done!,,
4,A book that my child wanted was out of stock,,
5,"hi just got the flyers i requested but I guess I didn't ask for the Lucky flyers or any that would be good for second graders.    In the future could you please send me any flyers See Saw, Lucky, you can be a reader, that  second graders would order from...  Thanks   Sarah Cox  2nd grade teacher  Holland Hall School  5666 E. 81   Tulsa, Ok 74137",,
3,Iâ€™m also a teacher so I love scholastic books,,
3,"the suggestions of books are very small, and it should have an option to search books by themes.",,
2,It would not let me spend the $5 in free books. We picked a $2 book and a $3 book but it would not let me order the two books.,,
1,I am frankly disgusted by Scholastic's false promises of free books for teachers.  I am far to busy to waste my time on nonsense.  I will inform my classroom parents that Scholastic has repeatedly failed to uphold its promises to reward teachers with free books for student purchase therefore I will no longer distribute monthly book order forms.  They can go to retail book shops in the future.,,
4,"I'm still learning how to navigate to what I need. Sometimes, it's not as intuitive as I'd like. Overall, I've had a positive experience with the site.",,
5,Easy to put in book order,,
5,I will be submitting an order next week. I had a parent ask for me to hold off until the weekend.,,
4,I wish there are more and better options in the Bonus Catalog.,,
5,MY CODE WOULDNT WORK SO I CALLED IN AND THEY WERE ABLE TO FIX IT!,,
4,will be processing order on Sunday waiting for a few more parents to order,,
4,"I'm always checking back on the site for new reading packs in our spanish classrooms.  We need more ""ready to read"" books for grades TK-3rd.",,
4,Some books are not competitively priced and are cheaper on amazon- so I will always check if they are not 2.00 or more I'll buy from scholastic but sometimes you are 5.00 more and I can't justify it.,,
5,"Love all the opportunites to earn extra points and books!  I like when you send birthday or bonus in the summer. I don't like having to remember to save the email or write them down, but I try!    I've been working on encouraging familes to support books/reading. The economy limits, but glad at least some can. I use my library to supplement.  Many teachers at my school already use Scholastic book orders or not interested, to I can't really recommend anymore.",,
3,thank you,,
2,Please allow for author searching and linking. Subjects as well. Sort filter features by price and reading level while I'm dreaming.,,
5,Easy to use with the item#s.,,
5,AMAZING DEALS! GREAT BUNDLES,,
5,VERY EASY TO USE ... WELL LAID OUT ... LIKE THE FACT THAT I CAN HAVE BOTH MY CHILDREN ON THE ACCOUNT AND A SIMPLE PULL DOWN FEATURE TO CONFIRM WHICH CHILD'S BOOK IS WHICH,,
3,still deciding what to order,,
1,Stop sending me emails and stop producing sooooo many flyers that I simply recycle. Stop!!!!!,,
2,It is just not user friendly. Lots of scrolling. and the information you're looking for is not really in the place you are looking for it to be in.,,
3,"I had a student send a check and an order, like they're supposed to.  One of the items he ordered is apparently out of stock.  Instead of a backorder sheet of stickers, it won't even let me place that order.  Now I've had to email his parents and ask if they want me to send the check back to be re-done or if I should choose a new $6 book.  Thanks for adding extra work on my plate Scholastic.",,
3,I am not getting notified when a parent makes an order.  I have called about this issue and it does not get resolved.  I do get an email when the box is on its way.  But i need to know when a parent places an order,,
5,Waiting for teachers book list and will be buying. And getting some for my friendsâ€™ kids. Iâ€™m so excited.,,
3,Code READS is not working. About to just not bother and not order these books.,,
5,Still plan to submit an order but wanted to verify the books in my cart my child.,,
4,Yesterday I submitted a student online order and mailed a student order and today I had another student online order. Since my orders were submitted on different days I was not able to receive any bonus points or rewards. Is there any way to get those credits?,,
3,"I entered a discount code as offered and instructed, but it did not take.",,
3,I still appreciate the tactile sense of browsing the printed Scholastic book order flyer.,,
3,"When on mobile, hard to find how to order for book club to benefit classroom.",,
4,Sign in period is too short.  Most times when browsing I need to come back and find I've been signed out.  It's just annoying to sign back in is all.,,
5,very easy to use,,
5,"I love scholastic, but I hope there are no delays like there were last year!",,
3,Website and selection are pretty sparse,,
2,"You were out of stock on over $80 worth of books towards my order. Now I have to contact all the parents and have them  write new checks, pick out new books  or discuss options. It is not a good look for the first few weeks of school. Also, I lose out on bonus points and book picks!",,
2,"Everytime I chat with someone, they end the chat before I can even respond. It is very frustrating. It happened just now with Yvonne and has happened each time I have chatted with someone on several occasions. They tell me their solution and then just end the chat. They don't even ask if there is anything else I need, or even provide a normal response time for me to respond each time they send a response or question to me. Can you please relay this along as customer service is getting a bad rep for this. Thanks so much.",,
3,"I don't think it's the most user friendly site. Also, I don't appreciate how Scholastic has raised the price so much that most of our families can't afford to get the books anymore.",,
4,"When used the promotion ""READS"" to get a free book for an order over $25, I was unable to search for titles. For example, I would type in ""pete"" for pete the cat books, however the search revealed no results. However when I deleted the title and just selected ""kindergarten"" grade, pete the cat books appeared as possible options.",,
1,"This has nothing to do with the website, but I am very disheartened that you charging shipping for student orders! I really don't think you should charge for teacher orders either.  I promote your books (for free I might add) and now I have a student that can not order because you are charging shipping for his books because his total is under 25.00. We all know it is getting harder and harder to get kids/parents to even order anymore and now this makes it even harder for those who do! I work in a small district and I have few kids that even order anymore, so getting to the 25.00 is hard. What if I had a student who can only afford a small amount and they were ordering all the books they could in the $1, $2, or $5 section? This is very sad to say the least and I am probably going to do away with even offering the orders and promoting them in my classroom. My student is no longer able to order the two books she wants because she can not cover the shipping charges. I am very disappointed!",,
5,Great!,,
5,Thanks for the great book selection!,,
4,It is annoying to me that the site works best in landscape over portrait on my iPad. I usually forget to turn it.,,
5,The site has been great. I'm just waiting on some more info and then I will place my order.,,
4,"It was difficult to find a ""free book"".  The one I chose for $5, the website said was not eligible.  Don't know why it wasn't.",,
4,It wouldn't let me enter my $5 free book.,,
2,"I have been a member of scholastic for over 30 years. The quality of reading of your product has gone down, in my opinion. There are not enough classic stories, too many graphic novels, and silly stories (Dog man, etc..) and these kind of books do not make my students smarter readers. I know these are the type of books that sell, but , in my opinion, they lower Scholastic's standards.",,
5,Everything worked very smoothly!,,
3,"Site was a little difficult to understand, originally did order through parent site, took me a little while to figure out I needed to check out on book club site so my child's teacher would get credit, would be easier if I could enter her classroom code on profile and it was automatically entered when I check out instead of trying to figure out which site I need to enter my order on. Very confusing.",,
2,"I simply wanted to change the number of fliers I'm receiving since I have a larger class this year. The person I did chat with told me I needed to go the the ""arrow"". When I asked what arrow, she said scroll down to the bottom of the screen, for teachers, and select catalogs. There I find I need to order specific catalogs for a one-time order. I've been teaching 15 years and have placed scholastic orders each of those years. This didn't used to be so difficult.",,
1,I couldnt use the READS coupon code.,,
4,"I am a retired teacher and had an account of my own for my classroom. I now want to purchase books for my grandson's teacher but when I enter my email address, I am taken to my teacher account, and the site won't let me create a parent account. I don't want to purchase unless the teacher gets credit.",,
5,I will place my personal order when students have placed their orders.,,
4,"The search functions are a little antiquated, but I was able to complete, thanks!",,
4,We used to have a warehouse right in our community.  When it shut down last year the delay on getting books WAS HUGE!  I decided not to order last year.  I am going to try again and hope that parents get their orders sooner than later.,,
4,I love the holiday books,,
5,We love when the scholastic flyers come home from school!,,
5,"The updates you are constantly making to the website are amazing and much appreciated. Each time I order, it is so much better. Thank you!",,
4,I have asked for a 4th grade flyer but have not received one- most of my parents need the paper flyer,,
5,Excellent!  Much easier to use than the old format of the site.,,
4,"We really wanted to purchase individual titles of the Owl Diaries, but they were not available.",,
4,"i wasn't able to find a way to search by topic, like self regulation.  I just had to hope it came up.  You should have a tab for kids on spectrum.  Maybe you do but it wasn't obvious.",,
3,I remember being a kid and loving scholastic book days when I got to buy books to read! While it's not exactly the same I did have fun going through the flyer with my son and picking out books he thought were interesting!,,
5,Scholastic's website is very user-friendly and I appreciate that!,,
4,Where do I mail my payment,,
3,"The website is sending my 4th grader's books to my 1st grader's teacher even though I signed them in and ordered separately using their own classroom codes.  It's not a huge deal for us because my kids will both get their books either way, but I really want each teacher to get the points for the right kid.  I'd also like my 4th grader to get his own order, because it's more fun to have them delivered to you in class instead of getting them later from your little brother.  Really  frustrating!",,
5,"Some trouble logging in - didn't accept password, but overall easier than usual.  As I've said before your site doesn't do well with Mozilla and other browsers that focus on privacy which is annoying as I have to use chrome or edge - whichever will work that day.  Also, my biggest pain is trying to enter the due dates.  Often the Drop-down calendar will not register my date.  It would be preferable to have an option to type in a date.  Thank you - hoping things are running more smoothly this year.",,
1,It will not let me order books. Nothing shows in my cart,,
3,I had to reload the page 3 times as a weird box kept coming up. I need to have flyers sent to me as I never got any and would like to make a class order. I can't find how to have flyers sent on your website.,,
1,"I hate having to create accounts for every website out there.  Why can't you just let us enter our information and make a purchase as a ""guest""?  I hate this so much that I have actually not made purchases from you in the past because of it, and I am undecided now if I'll make a purchase tonight.  I came to this website tonight with full intention of placing an order, but now I might not.",,
5,The Scholastic Book Clubs website is very easy to follow.,,
4,"It is difficult to get to the correct page---the clubs.scholastic is not easy to find just by Googling ""Scholastic"".  That would be my only recommendation is to make the clubs easier to navigate to from the main page.",,
3,Trying to apply discounts.,,
5,"if possible filters allowing me too look at subjects per age.  For example... fears/anxiety & age  options with 'where is my monster'.  Also maybe select value packs as alternate purchases when you select a particular book.   I found the above example after searching examples, then put it directly in to see if you had the book as an option.  After I completed my order I discovered there was a value pack with another similar book.",,
5,Very easy to navigate and user friendly.,,
3,What my child wanted was out of stock,,
5,I like how the site keeps track of earned rewards so I don't have to figure it out on my own with codes etc.,,
4,When searching for books to add the site often lags.,,
5,fast and friendly to use,,
5,I chatted with an agent and they fixed it. I had an old account that they ended up merging with my new account.,,
4,"Some item numbers didnâ€™t match the flyers, but overall, easy to shop and place my order!",,
5,Christine was a helpful person online earlier this evening.,,
4,I would like to have the option to ship my order/books to my home address.,,
4,Not enough non-fiction or STEM related books selections,,
1,"The code says expired. I did what the person in chat said to do and it still doesn't work. I don't think I will be ordering, at least online, again any time soon",,
5,Great selections of books for my little reader.,,
5,I appreciate the code for a free book and free shipping!  Thank you!,,
5,The READS coupon didnâ€™t work :(,,
3,Always have a little trouble submitting my free book selection,,
1,website is not formulated to be used with a cellphone. wouldnt even let me submit payment on my cellphone i had to use a desktop computer.,,
4,I wish that scholastic carried adult books.,,
3,I had trouble figuring out why I was about to pay shipping and why I couldn't find some books my daughter wanted.,,
5,I love how easy it is to navigate.  Thank you!,,
3,"I put items in my cart, but the site would not let me log in so I could buy the books I wanted to purchase. I had an account last year and my grandson s now in first grade, so i need to chanfge classrooms, which i did, but then I could not log in. I tried to create a new account, but could not do that either. I am not impressed with your website a the moment.",,
3,I went to scholastic.com and it was not intuitive and difficult to find how to submit an order through my kid's teacher and use the fliers,,
5,I enjoy ordering books from Scholastic.  Great deals.,,
5,I love the books and that I can easily order books for my son without sending money into school with him.,,
5,Great website! keeps kids entertained all night sitting at the dinner table from 4:30-9:00 there bed time.,,
5,Got great suggestions and searching for specific books was easy.,,
5,Smooth ordering experience.  Thank you..,,
4,n/a,,
4,The scroll side bar is so skinny to move.  I hope shipping timeline has improved to pre pandemic schedule.,,
3,the number are not the same as in the flyer.,,
3,Password reset,,
4,"not hard, but not very easy finding the right flyer to order the books",,
3,The phone number to call in said it could not be completed at this time. I sent an email. I will see what happens.,,
2,"Why are you selling books that normalize harsh parenting methods that humiliate and shame children?  While browsing, I saw a book called ""David Gets in Trouble"" that showed a child on the cover sitting in a corner.  The 1950s called and they would like their degrading treatment of children back.  Additionally, I saw you are selling the ""How Do Dinosaurs..."" series which also normalizes emotionally aggressive relationships between parents and children.  Families have problems, yes.  Please do not normalize parental mistreatment of children and CONDITIONAL (rather than unconditional) love.  Please sell books that depict healthy methods of parents guiding their children morally and ethically.  Children being mistreated by their parents don't always realize that what their parents are doing is not healthy.  Normalizing harsh parenting through literature does not help.  It can take years for children to realize that their parents mistreated them and they should not repeat the same patterns",,
5,"I've been a big fan of Scholastic Book Clubs for many years and appreciate the work the company does and how they support literacy not only at my center, but across the country.",,
4,I tried to pull up the2nd & 4th grade flyers to view. they never came up even after I clicked the help if  having trouble,,
5,Love scholastic!! Kids need to hold books.,,
1,I was searching for the book order that I made for my son early in the year (2020 - 2021) . I have never received this order or an explanation as to why not. I will make no future purchases. When I searched for my order after logging in. it said I had no orders. What the heck happened!,,
5,Very easy to use once I entered the age of my child I was able to see a great selection,,
4,Would like to order individual books from the black is beautiful 5 pack,,
5,The site was easy to use and I placed an order with no issues.,,
4,I am still a bit hesitant after last year's first order took over two months.  I shared with families this month but if orders do not come in within 2 weeks we will not send home to parents again.,,
5,The digital flyer wouldn't always come up,,
4,I am just browsing to see what is new and available.  I am the grandparent and will have the books shipped.,,
4,"Not really a difficulty, but I would have liked to be able to specify ""grandparent"" rather than parent.",,
4,"Overall, a good experience however the prices are a little high!",,
5,Very easy,,
4,"I was looking for a way to request paper, book order catalogs to hand out to my students.",,
4,It would be great if you could search by lexile/reading level.  Or even if you could easily access flyers from other grades as my child is reading above her grade level.,,
4,"It's not clear when we will receive the book? With online orders, I like to know when to check back in in case something gets lost.",,
5,"I love scholastic book clubs! The user interface is easy to use and I LOVE getting points with every order, it makes me able to supply my home and classroom with wonderful books to read.",,
4,It was hard to get to the flyers but overall it was a good visit!,,
4,"Not difficulties per se, but the website doesn't always feel intuitive for figuring out how to do what I need as a teacher. This is only my second year, so maybe that's why.",,
3,"on 9-9 I submitted orders for Emery and Alcie.  Alcies ordered was delivered today, But   Emerys was not and I do not see it on the site.",,
5,I loved that we got a free book from the $5 page!,,
4,I was interested in many of the book packs but already own 1 or 2 in most of them and wish the titles that you were interested in were available to purchase on their own.,,
5,Looking for classroom books and books for my family. I will submit class order tomorrow.,,
3,Last year I stopped ordering because it was a mess.  If it goes back to the previous year I would love to use it again.  Plus all four kindergarten teachers had a bill for the whole school year and our PTO had paid it.  I gave you scores based on last year.,,
2,The process of entering my students new teacher took more time than it should have and finally someone had to do it that works for scholastic.  It should be a simple process to change teachers at the beginning of the new year.,,
5,My customer number is not the same number I've used for the last 35 years??????,,
5,Site is easy yo navigate,,
5,"I was able to find what I needed. The item numbers were very helpful with that. It was nice to get a free book with code--READS.     I think I get too many emails from the scholastic book club. In all honestly, it's the fliers that I look at before getting books. Not that I'd never want emails, but I just get too many emails, so I reach a point where I just start unsubscribing from groups.",,
5,I will be placing an order tomorrow and I wanted to look at any changes to the site.,,
3,I wish the $1 books would come back. Some teachers can not afford to buy $75 worth of book before we can access the $1 books. Its hard enough to afford a $1 book for each of my students each month. I hate that I haven't been able to provide my students with more book this last year like I did my first year.,,
5,Me encanta super,,
5,Absolutely love Scholastic and the experience of it. So excited my kids get to be a part of this now too.,,
4,I am waiting to see if I get any more orders.,,
4,Tracking #â€™s would be appreciated,,
5,Very easy and connected to my daughters class with the code right away.,,
4,I need a tax exempt button,,
4,"It's my first time on the site and I really enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't like was that it did not let me know what the delivery time would look like. Overall, it's a nice and self-explanatory site.",,
4,I canâ€™t find my class added to my profile yet.,,
5,I didnâ€™t get the promo code to work,,
5,"My confirmation page after my order was complete gave me an error message saying that it took too long to load and needed me to resubmit it, but when I refreshed the page, my order confirmation was there anyway.",,
5,very simple step by step   Thank you :-),,
4,Diana finally help me get into the sight I needed. Thank you,,
5,Could not find books that I was looking for.      Had problems last year with delivery of books.  Hope it goes better this year.,,
5,"Using the site is simple, which I can appreciate!",,
1,"I ran out of during this visit to the website, but I will be placing my order shortly. :)",,
3,"It was very hard to find the correct place to go. First, I was on the generic ""Scholastic"" website and while I connected to the school, I was not able to connect to my child's teacher. Shipping to the teacher's classroom didn't work. When I tried the chat feature for help, the session timed out and I never got help. I eventually found the correct ""Book Club"" site and entered books straight from the flyer from school.     So overall...tricky to navigate the website.",,
4,Love getting books for my kids and helping the teacher.,,
2,Get this woke crap off your site. The more woke stuff there is the less I buy. Shame.,,
5,I love having the opportunity to add to our home library and help out my child's classroom,,
2,I have now filled out the request for paper flyers twice. Please follow through and send them soon.,,
5,"Biggest challenge was figuring out which books were in a boxed series. I was shopping for the Magic Tree House series and needed a specific ""next"" box set. I couldn't easily distinguish which set was the correct one for me to select. The numbers were not listed in the title of the product.",,
5,"I couldn't remember my password but if I had known the ""requirements"" I would've been able to remember it.  Maybe it would be helpful to know how many characters the passwords are?",,
1,"The flyer from the teacher, does NOT match on-line.",,
4,"It can be hard to find books even with the search feature.  For instance I typed in ""Babysitters Club"" and it only offered me the 5 book pack, but I knew there was an individual book available.",,
1,I was searching for the book order that I made for my son early in the year (2020 - 2021) . I have never received this order or an explanation as to why not. I will make no future purchases. When I searched for my order after logging in. it said I had no orders. What the heck happened!,,
1,Unable to get to the Cary to purchase.,,
4,"It would be nice to be able to easily share a child's wishlist, with easy connection to the teacher's  class code#.",,
1,"After the multiple poor experiences I had last year, I am not participating in book orders in my classroom this year.",,
3,"Had been calling to clarify my order. Still missing a book I ordered back on May 20, 2022.  I did not appreciate that a call back was never made from Scholastic.  I had to log in, call, send a message and finally, took me submitting a chat before I had my questions answered.",,
5,Is there a better way to search for all non-book items that are available to purchase? My middle schooler likes the posters and other items that are usually available during the book fairs. I was unable to locate any of those items during my search.,,
4,My child's teacher was listed at her former school. I let her know so she can update it.,,
3,"For books that are part of a series, I wish you would say which number it is. As an example, I know my son likes The Bad Guys, but I don't know which numbers you have for sale.",,
5,It sent me straight to the survey before I could order. I will do so now.,,
5,All around great,,
5,Excellent choice of books and great prices.  Thanks for making ordering so easy.,,
5,"Christon was very helpful. I didn't get to tell them because  I clicked something and the chat disappeared from screen, though  I heard a couple extra messages.",,
5,Easy and quick to order!,,
4,"I think it's great that we can select a child's name when we have multiple children in the Scholastic System. I like that feature in the cart and the ability to add to their wishlist. The struggle that I have with that, is that when earning free books, we may spend $25 on each child, but we would still only receive one free book. It makes it more effective for me to submit two orders so they can each pick their own free book, but I know it's more costly for you.     In addition, the books and series that my children like most were out of stock. That prompted me not to submit an order today. It seems that the books or series that my children want (and within a price range I am willing to spend with each book order) always seem to be out of stock.",,
4,Site was quick and easy to navigate.,,
4,the flyers are glitchy,,
5,Site is very easy to navigate. I love that we can create a wish list for next time!,,
4,Some difficulty finding the location for the classroom code.,,
1,I am frustrated that the last two orders I made were canceled and not by me!  I choose to have our orders come to my home because we are within a high school that does not give us our mail.,,
4,Not all books are available that are available on the regular website of scholastic,,
3,The site is always so easy to use!,,
5,"I was very happy to have immediate help from ""Ronda"" on the live chat. She was able to find the information I needed in a timely manner and was quite courteous.    I was a little surprised to find that I could not look up the amount in my child's E-wallet without the help of Ronda, I have the tendency to think I've done something, but in fact just thought about doing it and I needed to make absolute sure that my daughter wouldn't be showing up on book fair day, unable to purchase anything with her class.      Other than the ability to check the amount in your child's E-wallet easily, everything else ran smoothly.",,
4,I had a hard time trying to change my password.,,
2,"I am unable to find books via searching. I searched for the title  ""Marcus Makes a Movie"" and the author ""Kevin Hart,"" among others and the books in your flyer did not come up. I used to work in a library so I know how to search books. I was able to use the item number, but it's absurd that using the titles of the book does not work. I am very disappointed with how poor your site operates.",,
3,Thank you guys for all you do.,,
4,Will be placing order later today,,
4,"It is hard to find the book club site versus the regular scholastic site.  Going forward, I believe I figured it out, but why separate the two so distinctly?  Thanks!",,
4,Sometimes the digital flyers would not load and I would have to keep refreshing the page. Other than that I am a big Scholastic fan and love ordering books!,,
3,difficult to figure out where to make changes to account.  Site not clear.,,
3,I started ordering under my name and it didn't automatically connect me with my son's teacher. I had to notice the price difference to the flyer and then went into the club section and was able to get the pricing I had for the flyer.,,
4,I like that I received an email when a family orders books online.,,
3,It wasn't clear that to order online we had to connect to a teacher. We were given a code to use but no instructions so when entering the website it was a bit difficult to navigate.,,
3,"On the main Scholastic page, there should be something to tell you to go to the Book Clubs section if you have a class code.",,
1,"Added items to the general scholastic purchasing site.  however, didn't know this wouldn't link me to the book clubs directly.  book clubs has a lot fewer options.  ended up buying at amazon.",,
4,"I like being able to see tons and tons of books, but I wish there was an option to search based on price and not by grade or age. I really like the selection of suggested books at the bottom of the page after you click on a book. I feel like there are so many books I am missing and struggle to be able to search appropriately on my phone.",,
4,Overall good experience.  I felt like the book recommendations were a bit on the young side.,,
5,Opened site and prepared for my children to choose their options. Very likely to come back. I remember being SO excited for Book Fairs and Book Clubs as a kid in school. It was definitely a highlight of elementary and even middle school!,,
4,none,,
4,I've struggled for years with the cc payment method on this site. Mostly around saving a cc/adding a new cc.,,
4,The coupon code for a free book expired before the book order is even due. Thatâ€™s frustrating!,,
4,I had to put in my card info a couple of times before it would accept it - kept saying invalid code. I had to enter things in a certain order.,,
5,"Took a long time to load, just closed the page and re-opened it about an hour later and all is good.",,
4,I wish you could see a photo of the books that are available with the code READS (Because apparently I literally want to judge a book by it's cover??).,,
5,"This was the fastest, EASIEST book order I have ever completed.  I usually have to call you to have somebody WALK ME through the process, but this time--------it was a CHARM!!  Sooooo-keep up the good work!!  (Of having an order form that flows logically!!)",,
5,Flyers take a long time to load,,
5,"very user friendly, fast & efficient",,
5,Anxious to provide opportunities for students to buy books.,,
4,The $10 to spend right now window was not available and I couldn't complete my order,,
4,"When a book is out of stock, i should be able to put in on a watchlist or something.",,
5,I appreciate the work taken to make Scholastic great again! Thank you!,,
4,Please add filters to narrow down search. Grade/Price/theme all on same page.,,
3,"I am not so sure how to enter my students and get flyers to parents. I am going to ask a coworker to help, who has used the site this year.",,
4,Some of the wording prices were overlapping. I couldn't read what was written in these areas.,,
4,Looking for graphic novels to try and interest a young boy to read.,,
5,not complete with my order. Did find letters for parents. Love them,,
1,"Page isn't formatted to view on Android mobile. The page is too big for mobile viewing. Can't see all the books when scrolling, it ""skips"" over half of them.",,
1,This website is goddawful. I canâ€™t figure out how to make an order and your tutorial only shows me how to send reminders and links to friends and family. Iâ€™ve been here ten minutes and I canâ€™t figure it out. Fix your website. It sucks.,,
