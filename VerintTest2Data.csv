Disappointed,cannot find where to add my child's class code to my account,TRUE
Disappointed,Changing teacher is a nightmare on site.,TRUE
Disappointed,"Everytime I chat with someone, they end the chat before I can even respond. It is very frustrating. It happened just now with Yvonne and has happened each time I have chatted with someone on several occasions. They tell me their solution and then just end the chat. They don't even ask if there is anything else I need, or even provide a normal response time for me to respond each time they send a response or question to me. Can you please relay this along as customer service is getting a bad rep for this. Thanks so much.",TRUE
Disappointed,"First, what the heck is the difference between a book fair and a book store? Why does it still look like I'm benefiting my niece's old school from past years, when I tried to sign up with my daughter's new school? Your flyers stopped loading for me after I'd looked at several. The cart doesn't have an easily visible total... I have to scroll all the way to the bottom, which feels like extra work when I just want to know where things stand before I add more books (or subtract some).",TRUE
Disappointed,Get this woke crap off your site. The more woke stuff there is the less I buy. Shame.,TRUE
Disappointed,"Historically, I find the Scholastic Book Club site very challenging to navigate",TRUE
Disappointed,How do I enroll children with different teachers? I tried to a child to my account but was not asked for the teacher code.  I could not figure how to see a classroom wishlist,TRUE
Disappointed,"I am a sub trying to place an order under the teachers name, however I couldn't do that successfully so I used my account from prior teaching.  So much hassle.",TRUE
Disappointed,"I am unable to find books via searching. I searched for the title  ""Marcus Makes a Movie"" and the author ""Kevin Hart,"" among others and the books in your flyer did not come up. I used to work in a library so I know how to search books. I was able to use the item number, but it's absurd that using the titles of the book does not work. I am very disappointed with how poor your site operates.",TRUE
Disappointed,"I can't find two students who placed an order.  My cart is empty, but it says I have two students who ordered.  I really hope this isn't a repeat of last year when I waited from Sept. to the end of Nov. for my first book order....",TRUE
Disappointed,"I have been a member of scholastic for over 30 years. The quality of reading of your product has gone down, in my opinion. There are not enough classic stories, too many graphic novels, and silly stories (Dog man, etc..) and these kind of books do not make my students smarter readers. I know these are the type of books that sell, but , in my opinion, they lower Scholastic's standards.",TRUE
Disappointed,I have not been able to intentionally get to a place to input the code from my flyer,TRUE
Disappointed,I have now filled out the request for paper flyers twice. Please follow through and send them soon.,TRUE
Disappointed,"I simply wanted to change the number of fliers I'm receiving since I have a larger class this year. The person I did chat with told me I needed to go the the ""arrow"". When I asked what arrow, she said scroll down to the bottom of the screen, for teachers, and select catalogs. There I find I need to order specific catalogs for a one-time order. I've been teaching 15 years and have placed scholastic orders each of those years. This didn't used to be so difficult.",TRUE
Disappointed,"I struggling with ordering simply because there isn't enough variety.  I'd like to see more stable books offered instead of bandwagon books that don't last the test of time.  Also, the prices are so high parents don't even want me to bother with sending out class orders.  I always hope I'll find something for my classroom, but that is getting very hard to do anymore.",TRUE
Disappointed,"I tried to submit my order yesterday.  When I clicked ""Submit Order"", it brought me back to the shopping cart but did not tell my why.  I tried multiple times, from different devices and it still wasn't working.  I then contacted costumer support via chat and the same thing was happening to that person.  She told me she'd put in a work order but I may not hear back for 2-3 days.  I decided to try again today and it did work.  This time, it gave me an error message in my cart telling me one of my items was out of stock.  I wish this error popped up yesterday so that I didn't have to spend my entire plan time trying to problem solve without luck.  Thankfully today it did work.",TRUE
Disappointed,I USED to teach... now I'm a grandparent and just want to order books for my grandchild... the website keeps going back to my teacher account.  FRUSTRATING!,TRUE
Disappointed,Im disappointed in the selection of books for $1 or $2.  A book for $1 popped up on my screen but it took me to a completely different section by that author. Not what I wanted.    Last year was a nightmare with Scholastic.  I'm praying its not like that again.,TRUE
Disappointed,It is hard to find the electronic wallet to add additional money.,TRUE
Disappointed,It is just not user friendly. Lots of scrolling. and the information you're looking for is not really in the place you are looking for it to be in.,TRUE
Disappointed,It will not add to my cart at all and I can't order.    I have a credit that I can't use.,TRUE

Disappointed,Scholastic has not been helpful......we are stilled owed books from last school year.,TRUE
Disappointed,"Signing in to do book fairs vs bookclubs and then being a teacher in one school, having two kids in another, another kid in another, and then being the Book Fair chair for a different school. It's so difficult! I've already messaged for assistance.",TRUE
Disappointed,"The links provided on the flyer didn’t work. I had to search and find the site , navigation was frustrating.",TRUE
Disappointed,The process of entering my students new teacher took more time than it should have and finally someone had to do it that works for scholastic.  It should be a simple process to change teachers at the beginning of the new year.,TRUE
Disappointed,The website is very difficult to navigate to find where to add funds to my childrens account for shopping at their book fair in person.  Links from the email just direct to the log in page and don’t get to where you are trying to go.  It would be nice to have a feature that would provide a link for family members to fund their book shopping account as well.,TRUE
Disappointed,"This was my second order and I thought, based on total dollars spent and the information presented, that the order qualified for $10 free books and a free group of books. I continued to choose the $10 in free books only to be charged the $10. After going back to the beginning several times, I realized I should read the small print that said the freebies were only once between August and September. If a teacher already utilized this freebie, it should not pop up and give an alert about this reward. Little hurdles like this when ordering seem to frustrate teachers. Make order user friendly please.",TRUE
Disappointed,Took forever to find the spot to enter my child's classroom code. Almost gave up and didn't order anything.,TRUE
Disappointed,VERINT TEST,TRUE
Disappointed,"Very frustrated-   Put $80 books in a cart, only to discover that's the ""retail side"" so I can't buy them from my son's class teacher book club.  Started over - picked $30 worth of goods, entered the READS promo code for free book and got no credit or option to pick a $5 book.  Forget it.",TRUE
Disappointed,Very hard to find the link for parents and the school book order.,TRUE
Disappointed,Very slow to load sign-in pages,TRUE
Disappointed,"Very slow, site freezing.",TRUE
Disappointed,"Why are you selling books that normalize harsh parenting methods that humiliate and shame children?  While browsing, I saw a book called ""David Gets in Trouble"" that showed a child on the cover sitting in a corner.  The 1950s called and they would like their degrading treatment of children back.  Additionally, I saw you are selling the ""How Do Dinosaurs..."" series which also normalizes emotionally aggressive relationships between parents and children.  Families have problems, yes.  Please do not normalize parental mistreatment of children and CONDITIONAL (rather than unconditional) love.  Please sell books that depict healthy methods of parents guiding their children morally and ethically.  Children being mistreated by their parents don't always realize that what their parents are doing is not healthy.  Normalizing harsh parenting through literature does not help.  It can take years for children to realize that their parents mistreated them and they should not repeat the same patterns",TRUE
Disappointed,"You were out of stock on over $80 worth of books towards my order. Now I have to contact all the parents and have them  write new checks, pick out new books  or discuss options. It is not a good look for the first few weeks of school. Also, I lose out on bonus points and book picks!",TRUE
Neutral,a little confusing which program is which and where to go to just order and look at books,TRUE
Neutral,"After selecting a book description, it's difficult to get back to the page where you can select a different flyer.    I would prefer more individual books instead of a pack of several.",TRUE

Neutral,"Had been calling to clarify my order. Still missing a book I ordered back on May 20, 2022.  I did not appreciate that a call back was never made from Scholastic.  I had to log in, call, send a message and finally, took me submitting a chat before I had my questions answered.",TRUE

Neutral,I am not able to find the scholastic code for families to use online to shop from my classroom,TRUE
Neutral,I am not getting notified when a parent makes an order.  I have called about this issue and it does not get resolved.  I do get an email when the box is on its way.  But i need to know when a parent places an order,TRUE
Neutral,"I am not so sure how to enter my students and get flyers to parents. I am going to ask a coworker to help, who has used the site this year.",TRUE
Neutral,I am sad that there are no longer packs of 10 books for $10.  I used these packs for all students to get a free book.,TRUE
Neutral,"I am truly not trying to sound negative or that I'm complaining, but your website is incredibly difficult to navigate. There are WAY to many things to look on every page that I go to. Perhaps student orders can show up as JUST their names with a drop down option if you want to see what they've ordered? I don't know... it's just really challenging every time I come to this site. Like I said, I'm NOT trying to complain... I LOVE children's books and I LOVE promoting them. I just have a really hard time on your website. Thank you",TRUE
Neutral,I am unable to figure out how to submit an order.,TRUE
Neutral,"I am unsure if I sent the email to parents. I was in the middle of adding students and I was told that my time expired. However, when entering names, I thought I could download the list but I saw that all those names came up as one student. Then, I could not delete my error so I had to continue and add students  one at a time. This involved typing name, clicking add, having to click in box again to type another name., etc. Then time expired and I do not know what students I have listed.   I did not continue because it would take more time.    I did share the SBC to 2 of our new colleagues. I hope they do not get discouraged.",TRUE

Neutral,I did have difficulty finding my teacher.  I was wondering if you ship to homes instead?,TRUE
Neutral,I did not see my ewallet for the fair tomorrow,TRUE
Neutral,"I don't think it's the most user friendly site. Also, I don't appreciate how Scholastic has raised the price so much that most of our families can't afford to get the books anymore.",TRUE
Neutral,"I entered a discount code as offered and instructed, but it did not take.",TRUE
Neutral,"I find that I often get redirected to the teacher store, when all I want is to order books through the book orders. I saw the flyers advertising a lot of 6 books for $7.00, which is so helpful for my book clubs, and I was just trying to see what other titles were offered in that same deal. It was hard to find that.",TRUE
Neutral,"I find the site has not been updated in 3 years, since I was last in the classroom. It is not the most user-friendly to maneuver in between the teacher wish list and book selecting. I wish multiple books could be added at once instead of one at a time.     It would be nice to have received physical copies of flyers.",TRUE
Neutral,I found the books i want to order and i love the weekly $1 book.  i intend on placing my order on friday,TRUE
Neutral,"I had a student send a check and an order, like they're supposed to.  One of the items he ordered is apparently out of stock.  Instead of a backorder sheet of stickers, it won't even let me place that order.  Now I've had to email his parents and ask if they want me to send the check back to be re-done or if I should choose a new $6 book.  Thanks for adding extra work on my plate Scholastic.",TRUE
Neutral,I had to reload the page 3 times as a weird box kept coming up. I need to have flyers sent to me as I never got any and would like to make a class order. I can't find how to have flyers sent on your website.,TRUE
Neutral,I had trouble figuring out why I was about to pay shipping and why I couldn't find some books my daughter wanted.,TRUE
Neutral,"I had trouble finding where to submit my child’s teacher & when I found it, my entire cart was deleted so I had to start over. It would be better if the scholastic site worked seamlessly with the school classroom pages.",TRUE
Neutral,I had trouble viewing the digital flyer.,TRUE
Neutral,I have an account but do not know how to enter class code,TRUE
Neutral,"I have been using Scholastic for years and I am currently having a difficult time recommending books to my kindergarten families.  The prices have increased tremendously, while the selection has decreased.  I'm hoping that you will offer most books in the $3 - $4 range with a few choices in the $2 range.  You are also offering books in packs, but not offering the titles separately.  I won't buy the pack when I already have most titles.",TRUE
Neutral,I have parents who place book orders after I have submitted the order.  It is less than 12 hours after I have done so and the parents are told their child's order will be shipped in October.  He then calls and is on the phone for over 30 minutes.  Why do you make it so difficult to place orders?  My class order is still processing so why is it even an issue?    Please email me.  I had another parent place an order a day later.  Will that order be sent with my class order?,TRUE
Neutral,"I like to view the flyers because it is easier to pick out titles I might be interested in purchasing.  The site was having issues and the flyers weren't coming up to view.  It was frustrating so I gave up and will try again later.  Also, I know inflation is causing everything to go up, but it is disappointing to see the once $1 books in each grade level flyer continues to go up.  I work at a Title I school and it is nice to see books that ALL kids can afford.  I usually purchase a large number of these deal books to give away in my library each month.  Now that chapter books cost $3+ I will not be able to purchase as many to give away.  I understand Scholastic is a business, but it is a little disappointing.",TRUE
Neutral,I liked that both children's orders were combined into one billing transaction. However both children should have had the ability to take advantage of the READ free book code. But only one child was able to select a free book.,TRUE
Neutral,"I ordered some books for my younger son because his teacher sent home a book order. So I connected him to his teacher's class. I then did the same with my older son because he wanted some books as well, but his teacher never actually gave us a book order or mentioned that she was putting one in.  I was just able to find her name in the website when I went to connect him to a teacher. Today, my younger son came home with his book order, but my older son did not. My older son's order still just says ""Submitted to teacher."" Is there something else that I need to do?",TRUE
Neutral,"I put items in my cart, but the site would not let me log in so I could buy the books I wanted to purchase. I had an account last year and my grandson s now in first grade, so i need to chanfge classrooms, which i did, but then I could not log in. I tried to create a new account, but could not do that either. I am not impressed with your website a the moment.",TRUE
Neutral,"I read the tutorial, but found it a little difficult to navigate the site and look at books. After I ordered I realized there were a LOT more books to choose from than I had seen. Oh well, next time. The prices are good. Not all books had a description of the story",TRUE
Neutral,I remember being a kid and loving scholastic book days when I got to buy books to read! While it's not exactly the same I did have fun going through the flyer with my son and picking out books he thought were interesting!,TRUE
Neutral,"i searched the graphic novel of i survived the attacks of september 11, 2001 and nothing came up",TRUE
Neutral,I started ordering under my name and it didn't automatically connect me with my son's teacher. I had to notice the price difference to the flyer and then went into the club section and was able to get the pricing I had for the flyer.,TRUE
Neutral,I still appreciate the tactile sense of browsing the printed Scholastic book order flyer.,TRUE
Neutral,"I struggled with the bundled options, its not easy to see details about each book.  Picture shows 4 books when there are 5- its a bit confusing.",TRUE
Neutral,I think that it should be noted that teachers should wait to enter in all their students orders at once otherwise we loose bonus points.,TRUE
Neutral,"I tried on my phone to enter a free book and submit my order,but it did not work so I went on my computer and tried and it worked.",TRUE
Neutral,I wanted to see more books beyond my child's grade.  The options were confusing to figure out and looked like that same books over and over again.,TRUE
Neutral,I was on the main website before I realized I had to click somewhere special to get to the order with my kiddo's teacher.,TRUE
Neutral,I went to scholastic.com and it was not intuitive and difficult to find how to submit an order through my kid's teacher and use the fliers,TRUE
Neutral,I wish the $1 books would come back. Some teachers can not afford to buy $75 worth of book before we can access the $1 books. Its hard enough to afford a $1 book for each of my students each month. I hate that I haven't been able to provide my students with more book this last year like I did my first year.,TRUE
Neutral,I wish there were more hard cover books.,TRUE
Neutral,"I would appreciate an easier way to look at the flyers...maybe in alphabetical list for with a picture of the book  beside each listing.    It would also be wonderful if there were more books available with a Christian theme, especially at Christmas and Easter.",TRUE

Neutral,I'm ordering for my granddaughter.  I WILL order again!,TRUE
Neutral,im still searching for books,TRUE

Neutral,It takes time to find the interesting books we want to order.,TRUE
Neutral,it was a pleasure to visit the website.,TRUE
Neutral,"It was very hard to find the correct place to go. First, I was on the generic ""Scholastic"" website and while I connected to the school, I was not able to connect to my child's teacher. Shipping to the teacher's classroom didn't work. When I tried the chat feature for help, the session timed out and I never got help. I eventually found the correct ""Book Club"" site and entered books straight from the flyer from school.     So overall...tricky to navigate the website.",TRUE
Neutral,It wasn't clear that to order online we had to connect to a teacher. We were given a code to use but no instructions so when entering the website it was a bit difficult to navigate.,TRUE
Neutral,"It's frustrating to not be able to get the next book in a series. For example, the Wings of Fire. My daughter read the first one to see if she liked it but we don't want the set because we already have the first one. We just want the second book, but will have to get it somewhere else.  Thanks",TRUE
Neutral,"It's not clear on your website for orders paid by check whether or not to include the paper order form.  Also, the Business Reply envelopes I'm sent with our flyer have the Scholastic Book Clubs' zip code as 45273-8504  The zip code on your website is different: 45263-0446 ... please correct.

I only want  to buy books that will get reread,  otherwise we just go to the local library  cheaper for me and less clutter at home.",TRUE
Neutral,Just initial navigation is a little confusing,TRUE
Neutral,Last year I stopped ordering because it was a mess.  If it goes back to the previous year I would love to use it again.  Plus all four kindergarten teachers had a bill for the whole school year and our PTO had paid it.  I gave you scores based on last year.,TRUE

Neutral,"Your site is not easy to follow to order the books. I had to use the sheets that were sent home from the school and then search for each book using the item number. I was not impressed with the site. I would recommend the books, but I would also warn everyone about using the site.",TRUE

Satisfied,DON'T SEE HOW TO SHARE FLYER WITH A PARENT,TRUE
Satisfied,"Easy to add items to wish list and cart. Sometimes navigation is difficult (e.g., once get to checkout, it would be nice to have a back button ('back to shopping'), rather than using the browser back button or having to go back 'home' and navigate back to where I was before entering checkout).",TRUE
Satisfied,Everything worked well.,TRUE

Satisfied,GREAT SITE ND VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND.,TRUE
Satisfied,"I am a retired teacher and had an account of my own for my classroom. I now want to purchase books for my grandson's teacher but when I enter my email address, I am taken to my teacher account, and the site won't let me create a parent account. I don't want to purchase unless the teacher gets credit.",TRUE

Satisfied,I am not sure that the entire process is intuitive but I am muddling through.,TRUE
Satisfied,I am still a bit hesitant after last year's first order took over two months.  I shared with families this month but if orders do not come in within 2 weeks we will not send home to parents again.,TRUE
Satisfied,I am surprised that my customer number was changed.  It was the same number for years.  Why did it change and did everything from my old account merge or do I have 2 accounts?,TRUE
Satisfied,I am waiting to see if I get any more orders.,TRUE
Satisfied,I believe I earned some free books but did not see a place to choose those books. This is the only time this has happened. I probably didn't see it.,TRUE
Satisfied,I can’t find my class added to my profile yet.,TRUE
Satisfied,I cannot print or download the parent letter.,TRUE

Satisfied,I had to put in my card info a couple of times before it would accept it - kept saying invalid code. I had to enter things in a certain order.,TRUE
Satisfied,"I had to re-load the page and log in 3 times before the teacher information became available to me. It did not show that I was a teacher with orders waiting. It kept showing an empty cart. In the end, using the same log in that I had used twice before, it finally showed my teacher information and allowed me to order.   Having said that, I still LOVE Scholastic.  You have been a mainstay of my classroom for so many years - I don't know what I'd do without you. 3",TRUE

Satisfied,I hope the shipping issues are resolved.,TRUE
Satisfied,"I like being able to see tons and tons of books, but I wish there was an option to search based on price and not by grade or age. I really like the selection of suggested books at the bottom of the page after you click on a book. I feel like there are so many books I am missing and struggle to be able to search appropriately on my phone.",TRUE
Satisfied,I like that the Scholastic website is easy to navigate and use. Look forward to things returning back to normal after the supply chain issues and the pandemic.,TRUE

Satisfied,I need a tax exempt button,TRUE
Satisfied,I need to make my status inactive.  I do not need any flyers right now and need to stop them from being mailed to me at my school.,TRUE
Satisfied,I started out on the Scholastic page and it took me a while to realize I need the Book Clubs page.,TRUE
Satisfied,"I think it's great that we can select a child's name when we have multiple children in the Scholastic System. I like that feature in the cart and the ability to add to their wishlist. The struggle that I have with that, is that when earning free books, we may spend $25 on each child, but we would still only receive one free book. It makes it more effective for me to submit two orders so they can each pick their own free book, but I know it's more costly for you.     In addition, the books and series that my children like most were out of stock. That prompted me not to submit an order today. It seems that the books or series that my children want (and within a price range I am willing to spend with each book order) always seem to be out of stock.",TRUE
Satisfied,I think there should be a way to import emails from google so that teachers don't have to manually enter them all in!,TRUE
Satisfied,I thought this was pretty straight forward. My only thing was that it took me a moment to find the button to see all books in the age group I selected rather than just a sample of what was available. Once I saw that link everything else was easy.,TRUE
Satisfied,I tried to find a book with a general description.  I was looking for a wipe-off book for help with the alphabet and numbers.,TRUE

Satisfied,"I was looking for a way to request paper, book order catalogs to hand out to my students.",TRUE
Satisfied,I was surprised by the price of the books!  Yikes!,TRUE
Satisfied,I was unable to find the book packs listed on the cover pages of the flyers sent to me.  I wasn't sure where to find them.   It was also difficult to see the text when I was viewing sample pages.  Sometimes I was able to get it to zoom in on the words by moving my mouse over and sometimes it would not.   It was also frustrating to have to keep clicking on the see full details button to read a description of the story.,TRUE
Satisfied,"i wasn't able to find a way to search by topic, like self regulation.  I just had to hope it came up.  You should have a tab for kids on spectrum.  Maybe you do but it wasn't obvious.",TRUE
Satisfied,I wish it was easier to use bonus points.,TRUE
Satisfied,I wish that scholastic carried adult books.,TRUE
Satisfied,I wish that you could also search for books by price.  I often have money to spend (earned rewards) and sometimes difficult to spend the exact amount.  Being able to search by price would help with this process.,TRUE

Satisfied,I wish the discount books were for teachers who didn't have to spend $75.  It would benefit my class who are limited to ordering books due to budgets!,TRUE
Satisfied,I wish there are more and better options in the Bonus Catalog.,TRUE
Satisfied,"I wish there was a way to search or sort by price. For example, as a parent (or a teacher) looking to build my library on a tight budget, I'd love to search for all the $5 and under books. Or knowing that Scholastic has dollar deals, all the $2 books.",TRUE
Satisfied,I wish you could see a photo of the books that are available with the code READS (Because apparently I literally want to judge a book by it's cover??).,TRUE
Satisfied,I wish you would not charge tax (just have it already added in the book price). Also I miss getting a receipt with my order.,TRUE
Satisfied,I work in the school library and would like to have the links to several age group flyers available in the email that gets auto created.,TRUE
Satisfied,I would like to have the option to ship my order/books to my home address.,TRUE

Satisfied,I would love to get more Spanish Scholastic order forms for my class since it is a Bilingual/ Dual Immersion class. Thank you!,TRUE
Satisfied,I would love to see Reading Group Book sets for lower GRL levels A-D.,TRUE
Satisfied,I would say not a huge difficulty but I had to reset my password and felt like I had to log in multiple times (2 or 3?) to complete the order. Not a huge problem but slightly annoying.,TRUE
Satisfied,"I'd love Free shipping, or some bonus to get free shipping.  I can't control whether many of my students order books or not.  With a $25 minimum, I have to send the book orders home less often to be sure more kids order books, so that I don't have to pay for shipping.  I'm just not willing to spend my money to pay shipping for my students' books.    Maybe there could be a minimum order amount for individual families to order and have it sent to school or home??",TRUE
Satisfied,"If connect to the teacher, should not require sign up process.",TRUE
Satisfied,If it is possible to look at books by theme a little easier it would be nice.,TRUE
Satisfied,"I'm always checking back on the site for new reading packs in our spanish classrooms.  We need more ""ready to read"" books for grades TK-3rd.",TRUE
Satisfied,I'm disappointed by the quality of some of the titles and the lack of low price books.  I think the selection has decreased over the past few years.,TRUE
Satisfied,"I'm still learning how to navigate to what I need. Sometimes, it's not as intuitive as I'd like. Overall, I've had a positive experience with the site.",TRUE
Satisfied,"It can be hard to find books even with the search feature.  For instance I typed in ""Babysitters Club"" and it only offered me the 5 book pack, but I knew there was an individual book available.",TRUE
Satisfied,It is annoying to me that the site works best in landscape over portrait on my iPad. I usually forget to turn it.,TRUE
Satisfied,"It is difficult to get to the correct page---the clubs.scholastic is not easy to find just by Googling ""Scholastic"".  That would be my only recommendation is to make the clubs easier to navigate to from the main page.",TRUE
Satisfied,"It is hard to find the book club site versus the regular scholastic site.  Going forward, I believe I figured it out, but why separate the two so distinctly?  Thanks!",TRUE
Satisfied,It just took me a while to find the dollar section that was available to me.  I hope that the books do not take as long as last year to arrive!,TRUE
Satisfied,it logged me out after a few minutes of inactivity but once i logged back in all my items were still in my shopping cart,TRUE
Satisfied,It timed out and did not keep what I had done. I had to re-enter everything.,TRUE
Satisfied,"It was difficult to access the dollar books, even though I had earned them.  Also tough to gain access to the visa funds I had from last year.",TRUE
Satisfied,"It was difficult to find a ""free book"".  The one I chose for $5, the website said was not eligible.  Don't know why it wasn't.",TRUE
Satisfied,It was hard to get to the flyers but overall it was a good visit!,TRUE
Satisfied,"It would be great if teachers/parents could search by price (for example in the search bar enter ""$1"" and all the $1 books came up)",TRUE
Satisfied,It would be great if you could search by lexile/reading level.  Or even if you could easily access flyers from other grades as my child is reading above her grade level.,TRUE
Satisfied,It would be great if you had a way to sort by price or browse for books below a certain price point.,TRUE
Satisfied,It would be helpful if we could see the titles of all books that are in book bundles before placing the order. I did not order the unicorn diaries bundle today because I couldn't read what titles were included.,TRUE
Satisfied,It would be helpful to be able to search by price. I would like to have more classic titles.,TRUE
Satisfied,"It would be nice to be able to easily share a child's wishlist, with easy connection to the teacher's  class code#.",TRUE
Satisfied,It would be nice to shop by flyer without having to download every flyer,TRUE
Satisfied,It wouldn't let me enter my $5 free book.,TRUE
Satisfied,it wouldn't let me sign in,TRUE
Satisfied,It’s difficult to swipe right and see all the books in a category.,TRUE
Satisfied,Its a good store like amazon and for school and the books are cheep,TRUE
Satisfied,It's hard to find the exact books on the teacher's list.,TRUE
Satisfied,"It's my first time on the site and I really enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't like was that it did not let me know what the delivery time would look like. Overall, it's a nice and self-explanatory site.",TRUE
Satisfied,"It's not clear when we will receive the book? With online orders, I like to know when to check back in in case something gets lost.",TRUE
Satisfied,It's not user friendly unless you are knowledgeable with the site,TRUE
Satisfied,I've struggled for years with the cc payment method on this site. Mostly around saving a cc/adding a new cc.,TRUE

Satisfied,Keep me logged in once I log in,TRUE
Satisfied,Kept freezing on the flyer's.,TRUE
Satisfied,"Last year when the orders arrived, each child's order was printed on a tear apart slip. This made it easy and efficient to sort large orders and ensure that all of the correct books were sent with each child. We also were able to send this slip with the books as a receipt showing the parent that they had received all we have record of them ordering,    This order I received had three pages of books listed and some of the student orders were in different places on different pages,    If possible, the tear apart slips or a place online to reference the orders would be great!

Satisfied,"My daughter is in a dual language program at school.  She has half the day in spanish. I wish that the Leo flier was more often. I know it used to be almost every month. Now  (unless that has changed this year)  it is only twice a year.  I think you should market your Leo flier to teachers that are DLI. Spanish books are more expensive (in my experience) and most of my child's teachers are new since the program is new to our school.  Also, I have really noticed that the prices on everything have gone up. I suppose it is due to the state of the world, but it makes me sad.",TRUE
Satisfied,"My school is not the right school, even though it's the right teacher.",TRUE
Satisfied,My students really like the paper flyers but we have not received any this school year.  Will they be sent in the future?,TRUE
Satisfied,N/A,TRUE
Satisfied,Need to make sure that I will be receiving my flyers at my site this year for each month. They did not come directly to me but came in bundles with other schools from the district in it. I often missed the flyers altogether because they never arrived at our site and I would have to call scholastic to send the flyers directly to me and that took a few days for them to arrive.,TRUE
Satisfied,none,TRUE
Satisfied,None at this time,TRUE
Satisfied,Not all books are available that are available on the regular website of scholastic,TRUE

Satisfied,Not enough non-fiction or STEM related books selections,TRUE
Satisfied,"not hard, but not very easy finding the right flyer to order the books",TRUE
Satisfied,"Not many parents are ordering books anymore.  I used to have huge book orders in the past.  Since my class didn't order 25 dollars worth, I missed out on the great coupon offers.  I don't want to add my own money to orders in order to get 10 dollars free.  Possibly add a 5 dollars free to the classroom that is under the 25 dollar mark.",TRUE
Satisfied,"Not really a difficulty, but I would have liked to be able to specify ""grandparent"" rather than parent.",TRUE

Satisfied,Sign in period is too short.  Most times when browsing I need to come back and find I've been signed out.  It's just annoying to sign back in is all.,TRUE
Satisfied,"Since the pandemic, I have not been getting the student flyers sent to school.  I REALLY want them to generate more orders.  PLEASE send them to school.  I emailed last year and sat on hold for a time to talk to a Rep about this and still have not received the paper flyers.",TRUE
Satisfied,"so so difficulty. It would be nice if when entering the free $5 book code, it would change the $5 book already on your order into the free book, rather than requiring you to enter the free book again and deleting the $5 book on your order.",TRUE
Satisfied,Some books are not competitively priced and are cheaper on amazon- so I will always check if they are not 2.00 or more I'll buy from scholastic but sometimes you are 5.00 more and I can't justify it.,TRUE
Satisfied,"Some item numbers didn’t match the flyers, but overall, easy to shop and place my order!",TRUE

Satisfied,"Still getting used to using the online, but I was not able to get back to the teachers list after I chose some books. Not sure if that's a user issue but I wish there was a visible tab to get back to that after making selections and checking my cart to see what my total was at. my intention was to spend 25 and then spend the $5 on a book for the teacher and I could figure out where her requests were.",TRUE

Satisfied,The $10 to spend right now window was not available and I couldn't complete my order,TRUE

Satisfied,"The search functions are a little antiquated, but I was able to complete, thanks!",TRUE
Satisfied,"The site is pretty easy to get around on.  I do like that you tell us right away if a book is out of stock.  Then we can just let the families know, and there is not this long wait time, like last year.  Thank you!",TRUE
Satisfied,The way the free book code needed to be entered was a bit confusing. I ended up ordering two copies of the same book.,TRUE
Satisfied,"The website (and this could be operator error) would get stuck as I was trying to place the orders.  It would not let me scroll down the list of the catelog to check certain books.  I had to refresh and then it let me scroll down.  Otherwise, I like the option of being able to look at the flyer and having items shipped to my home so that they are not lost at the school. or if we need to go virtual with the pandemic.  Thank you for making these changes.  I have always loved Scholastic book club.",TRUE

Very Disappointed,I am frankly disgusted by Scholastic's false promises of free books for teachers.  I am far to busy to waste my time on nonsense.  I will inform my classroom parents that Scholastic has repeatedly failed to uphold its promises to reward teachers with free books for student purchase therefore I will no longer distribute monthly book order forms.

Very Disappointed,"I ran out of during this visit to the website, but I will be placing my order shortly. :)",TRUE
Very Disappointed,I s till do not know how to submit an order with money brought to me by a student that is in cash - I have to pay out of pocket up front for this?,TRUE
Very Disappointed,"I was going to order some books for my daughter per her preschool's request, as I have done countless times before, as this is for our 5th child.  I wanted to buy some Christian books in addition to secular ones.  When I typed in ""Jesus"" into the search bar, there was not one result.  I typed in ""God.""  Nothing.  If you can't have one book about Jesus, I can't buy from you and I will be sure to let all my friends know.  Interestingly there are results for search words like ""gay"" and ""transgender.""",TRUE
Very Disappointed,I was searching for the book order that I made for my son early in the year (2020 - 2021) . I have never received this order or an explanation as to why not. I will make no future purchases. When I searched for my order after logging in. it said I had no orders. What the heck happened!,TRUE
Very Disappointed,"If you are going to advertise a promotion like READS, you should take it down if it's no longer available, which is the message that appears in my cart when I am ordering well over the required amount.   You're being very misleading in your advertising.   But for supporting our teacher through the promotion you are giving to teachers whose parents place orders before September 30th, this experience makes me not want to shop from Scholastic again.",TRUE
Very Disappointed,It said general error.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,It was difficult to find the site.  I was redirected several times to other scholastic sites.  Your book selections are very political.  I just want to get my kid a story book.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,It will not let me order books. Nothing shows in my cart,TRUE
Very Disappointed,"My child is added to my teacher/school within ""My Account, My Children"" in our profile. However, no option comes up for me to ""add his name"" to each book at checkout. No matter what I try to add to my cart, when I go to the cart it's always empty w/an alert in red to assign my child to each book. Very frustrating! I've tried removing my child & adding him back to his teacher/school & that didn't work. I'm not going to create a new account because I've ordered with no issue last year. I don't want to assign a new e-mail address just to order. I've tried both on my iphone and on two computers and nothing works.",TRUE
Very Disappointed,My shipping and payment page does not display the payment method or information necessary to make a payment.   I spoke with a represenative last year and was under the impression that the page would be fixed.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,Navigating the mobile site is difficult,TRUE
Very Disappointed,"Options to pay previous account balances online, not via telephone for ALL. Offer National Geographic novels in higher levels.",TRUE
Very Disappointed,"Page isn't formatted to view on Android mobile. The page is too big for mobile viewing. Can't see all the books when scrolling, it ""skips"" over half of them.",TRUE
Very Disappointed,"PS, not buying any books on here until you provide more unifying, less divisive subject matter.",TRUE
Very Disappointed,Rested an account one for each child then could not get to a place to order for youngest. I was stuck at the oldest.   Will go out and try again,TRUE
Very Disappointed,signing up i did not get points or neither did the person who shared. Also the sign up was really buggy.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,still can not find where the editable flier is to send home,TRUE
Very Disappointed,Stop sending me emails and stop producing sooooo many flyers that I simply recycle. Stop!!!!!,TRUE
Very Disappointed,"The code says expired. I did what the person in chat said to do and it still doesn't work. I don't think I will be ordering, at least online, again any time soon",TRUE
Very Disappointed,"The flyer from the teacher, does NOT match on-line.",TRUE
Very Disappointed,"The interface takes me in circles when I'm trying to find something. It has always been challenging to have a teacher and parent account simultaneously, they do not pair well together. Very frustrated that my account is under a parent and I have no way to change it to an educator. I just want flyers to send to my students and have no way to access it or request flyers.",TRUE
Very Disappointed,The page is stuck on the check out screen  Very frustrating,TRUE
Very Disappointed,The search is useless.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,"The site is very confusing to me.  It says it's the class page but it's hard to tell if the teacher has picked out books for the class or what.  Also, there is just too much going on on the page, it's hard to know where to go, which section to look in, etc.",TRUE
Very Disappointed,"The site loads slowly, shows books I don't click on. The digital flyer is clever but not user-friendly. At all. A different format (maybe that looks less likely the flyer) would work better.",TRUE
Very Disappointed,"The system would not allow me to place and order and ship to my home.  The children are in the middle of a nasty divorce, and I would like to have the books shipped to my home.  If the father receives the books, he will not return them.  Additionally, I order other items for Christmas and Birthdays, as well as for other grandchildren.  I would like those to be a surprise.  The system should allow me the option to ship to my home and pay for it.",TRUE
Very Disappointed,"This has nothing to do with the website, but I am very disheartened that you charging shipping for student orders! I really don't think you should charge for teacher orders either.  I promote your books (for free I might add) and now I have a student that can not order because you are charging shipping for his books because his total is under 25.00. We all know it is getting harder and harder to get kids/parents to even order anymore and now this makes it even harder for those who do! I work in a small district and I have few kids that even order anymore, so getting to the 25.00 is hard. What if I had a student who can only afford a small amount and they were ordering all the books they could in the $1, $2, or $5 section? This is very sad to say the least and I am probably going to do away with even offering the orders and promoting them in my classroom. My student is no longer able to order the two books she wants because she can not cover the shipping charges. I am very disappointed!",TRUE
Very Disappointed,This was such a terrible experience.  What books come in the five book bonus pack? How do you pay for the dollar books?  How does the teacher  purchase books for the classroom from the flyer?  What are thee bonus points for? If I send you the paper order how do I know who gets what? Come on scholastic- make it stress free for the teacher too!,TRUE
Very Disappointed,This website is goddawful. I can’t figure out how to make an order and your tutorial only shows me how to send reminders and links to friends and family. I’ve been here ten minutes and I can’t figure it out. Fix your website. It sucks.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,"Too much anti-American content or divisive material on here.  I could not find any material on pride in country, being a responsible American citizen, or Founding principles.  If Scholastic cannot expand its subject matter, I’d rather not receive this newsletter.     Do better.",TRUE
Very Disappointed,Unable to get to the Cary to purchase.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,was trying to find my Bonus Points #.    I  want to know IF I can transfer my balance of points to another Teacher  at a different school.  I am retiring & dont need them.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,website is not formulated to be used with a cellphone. wouldnt even let me submit payment on my cellphone i had to use a desktop computer.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,Website is slow to respond and download.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,when I am at checkout and have $ to use - I should be able to pull up my wish list and add those books in.  This is very frustrating.  The system really needs to be easier for teachers.  We don't have time to navigate back and forth.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,When I click sign in a white blank box comes up and I am unable to sign in.  I can sign in at my school but not at home. I tried connecting to my hotspot- that didn't work either. Why can I not sign in at home?,TRUE
Very Disappointed,Why aren't the club and teacher site connected. Very lame.,TRUE
Very Disappointed,"You don't list prices! This is insane.     Why are you trying to trick your customers, Scholastic Book Club? I am really disappointed in you. Really pathetic.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,A book is out of stock.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,A parent wrote a check to Scholastic while the rest of the parents sent cash.  I paid for everything on my debit card.  This means I need to contact the parent who wrote a check to you and ask them to rewrite it.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Adding to wish lists so that when I can get class codes (teachers haven't been updated for this year).,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Always user-friendly. I did not place an order today but will very soon!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Biggest challenge was figuring out which books were in a boxed series. I was shopping for the Magic Tree House series and needed a specific ""next"" box set. I couldn't easily distinguish which set was the correct one for me to select. The numbers were not listed in the title of the product.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,Came to check on student order that was shipped- wrong set of books was sent.  I will be contacting customer service again as this is the 2nd time it happened this year.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Christon was very helpful. I didn't get to tell them because  I clicked something and the chat disappeared from screen, though  I heard a couple extra messages.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,Codes did not match my pamphlet,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Could not find books that I was looking for.      Had problems last year with delivery of books.  Hope it goes better this year.,TRUE

Very Satisfied,First time on the site and I love it. Will come back to the site with my wife and child to pick out a few books. Thank you.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Flyers take a long time to load,TRUE
Very Satisfied,For holidays I like to purchase my students a book such as Spookley the Square Pumpkin or Twas the Night Before Christmas.  The last few years many of these popular books are only offered in book bundles instead of individually.  Could you please also offer books individually so that we may purchase these classics for our entire class.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Glad to see the shipping issues of the past seem to be fixed.  I will place my next order soon!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,had a difficult time looking for the class wishlist.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"hi just got the flyers i requested but I guess I didn't ask for the Lucky flyers or any that would be good for second graders.    In the future could you please send me any flyers See Saw, Lucky, you can be a reader, that  second graders would order from...  Thanks   Sarah Cox  2nd grade teacher  Holland Hall School  5666 E. 81   Tulsa, Ok 74137",TRUE
Very Satisfied,Hoping the delayed shipping issues of last year are no longer around! Kids always excited for books to arrive and the 6 weeks of last year was a bit long to wait!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I absolutely love this company. I know that last year you had difficulties that were outside your reach. But this year I've already placed one order and received it in record time. Keep up the great job.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I am eager to get back to book orders after supply chain delays.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I am hoping that orders will be delivered in a more timely fashion this year.  Last year, orders would take up to three weeks to process and parents were getting upset.  I am hoping there will be a faster turn around time this year.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I am hoping that shipping is a lot more timely this year.  I quit ordering last year(after 35 years of book ordering) because of the shipping time.  (I was embarassed in front of my class),TRUE
Very Satisfied,I am not sure how to email parents directly from scholastic,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I am not sure that I fixed my problem.  I have not been receiving flyers this year.  I tried to update my class info again in hopes they will start coming!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I appreciate the opportunity to offer my students a variety of books to purchase.  I would like to see ""small group"" sets of books for my new grade level to purchase.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I completed the survery before I was able to put in my order for it popped up as I was about to do the order/bonus part of the website. The survey should come up at the end, not at the start.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I couldn't complete my order because one of the student order was out of stock and I had to contact the parent to see if they wanted to change their order or get reimbursed. I used the chat feature for the first time.  I really like that feature.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I couldn't find one of the books that was on my granddaughter's flyer.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I couldn't find teacher's name. I will wait to get her class code to submit my order as I noted that purchases help teachers get free books for the classrooms. Thanks,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I couldnt pay with my international card, or my international paypal",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I couldn't remember my password but if I had known the ""requirements"" I would've been able to remember it.  Maybe it would be helpful to know how many characters the passwords are?",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I didn’t get the promo code to work,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I do not see my Bonus Points for Teacher Referrals:  Briana Snyder  Alex Castellanos  Also, how do get the 300 bonus points for ordering before September 30th.  Please advise.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I don't like the online necessity of paying sales tax on book purchases.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I entered the code for a free book but it didn't take anything off of the amount of my order.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I find the site hard to navigate.  The collections can sometimes be helpful, but it would be nice to be able to just look through all titles at once.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I found a book to add to the wish list. I will likely order it when I make my next book order.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I found some good books to order today, but I'm surprised by how the flyer is shrinking.  I'm not sure if it's smaller to include more books on a page, or if the selection is shrinking.  I hope that you continue to include quality books and a good selection each month.  I'd be really disappointed if your selection diminished.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I had to link my kiddo's new teacher and it was super easy! Thanks, Scholastic!",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I have changed grade levels. I want to continue to improve literacy with my ELL and regular education students.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I haven't ordered yet, but I did add to my cart.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I haven't tried to get those catalogues yet, so I'm not sure if I'll be successful.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I kept going to book fair vs book club. but I found my way and items,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I like being able to type the codes from the flyer and finding the books right away!,TRUE

Very Satisfied,I liked being able to type the item number from the paper order form into the search box.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I liked the questionnaire option that helped me choose a book for my child.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I look forward to coming back as a classroom teacher. :),TRUE
Very Satisfied,I love scholastic book club. It has been a slow start after the pandemic but I am hoping this year will blossom with readers!    I loved your videos they were so helpful in doing the things I needed to get done!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I love scholastic, but I hope there are no delays like there were last year!",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"i love scholastic, the joy of getting my books in class sparked my love of reading and im happy to pass that love on to my child!",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I often struggle with on-line sites and orders.  This by far was one of the easiest transactions I have encountered,  Kudos to all involved.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I placed an order for my class yesterday 9/16/2022 by phone. I did not have any online orders. However a student placed an on line order this morning so I placed this order today. It was very easy to place this on line order.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I plan to submit an order today, but I'm not done shopping",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I see there is now a minimum $25 in order to receive the free shipping. There are times I have had only a couple parents order and my total amount is under this. I as a teacher would NOT want to incur the $6.50 S&H fee.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I want to get back to Scholastic Book Clubs to help my students build their reading skills. I look forward to recving  the order forms.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I was able to find what I needed. The item numbers were very helpful with that. It was nice to get a free book with code--READS.     I think I get too many emails from the scholastic book club. In all honestly, it's the fliers that I look at before getting books. Not that I'd never want emails, but I just get too many emails, so I reach a point where I just start unsubscribing from groups.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I was just adding a student order today and doing a little classroom shopping.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I was trying to use the READS code for the free book for several weeks and it kept saying ""expired"" but it wasn't... Finally got it to work! Thanks for the free book.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I was very happy to have immediate help from ""Ronda"" on the live chat. She was able to find the information I needed in a timely manner and was quite courteous.    I was a little surprised to find that I could not look up the amount in my child's E-wallet without the help of Ronda, I have the tendency to think I've done something, but in fact just thought about doing it and I needed to make absolute sure that my daughter wouldn't be showing up on book fair day, unable to purchase anything with her class.      Other than the ability to check the amount in your child's E-wallet easily, everything else ran smoothly.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"I went in today to modify my profile for my new school & role. I wish there was a way that I could indicate that I am not a classroom teacher, I am a support specialist. I still order books to use with students, but I don't need you to send me class flyers.  Is there a way for me to do this?",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I will be placing an order tomorrow and I wanted to look at any changes to the site.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I will be submitting an order next week. I had a parent ask for me to hold off until the weekend.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I will confirm with my daughter which books my granddaughter would like this time and then come back.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I will most likely submit an order this month. The only reason I didn't do it today is because I am waiting for my class due date before I submit.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I will place my personal order when students have placed their orders.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"if possible filters allowing me too look at subjects per age.  For example... fears/anxiety & age  options with 'where is my monster'.  Also maybe select value packs as alternate purchases when you select a particular book.   I found the above example after searching examples, then put it directly in to see if you had the book as an option.  After I completed my order I discovered there was a value pack with another similar book.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,I'm just pre shopping of our next book order for Christmas gift ideas.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I'm just waiting for my kids to add books to the cart before I submit my order.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,I'm so glad you're still in business!  I am thrilled that at least one student placed an order.  Sure wish it were more!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Is there a better way to search for all non-book items that are available to purchase? My middle schooler likes the posters and other items that are usually available during the book fairs. I was unable to locate any of those items during my search.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,It sent me straight to the survey before I could order. I will do so now.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"It's always pretty easy to use.  If you ever make changes I'd suggest they only be slight. It's easy to search, easy to add by code, easy checkout, etc. Totally overhauling the site without keeping that simplicity in place would be a nightmare.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,It's nice to be able to reward teachers and provide valuable reading assets to my children.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Just checking on student orders submitted online.  I will submit them on Friday.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Just checking up on my class order which is due later this week.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Just wondering if parents could be prompted to select a free book when their order is over $25.  I have a family that earned a free book, but didn't make a selection.  It would be nice if they could be prompted for these rewards just like teacher's have on their checkout page.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Kindly watch the woke content.  You have a duty to provide wholesome, unbiased literature to our children.  It's a powerful position to be in, please respect it.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,Looking forward to ordering book for this school year.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Love all the opportunites to earn extra points and books!  I like when you send birthday or bonus in the summer. I don't like having to remember to save the email or write them down, but I try!    I've been working on encouraging familes to support books/reading. The economy limits, but glad at least some can. I use my library to supplement.  Many teachers at my school already use Scholastic book orders or not interested, to I can't really recommend anymore.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,Love Scholastic Book Club since I was a child. As a teacher I am trying to show how wonderful books are and where they can buy them.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Love scholastic!! Kids need to hold books.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Much easier to order online than it is to submit orders the old fashioned way like I used to have to do when I was in school!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Much easier to use this year.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"My class and I love Scholastic Book Clubs! I know shipping was a nightmare during covid but I ordered many books last year for my class and parents and I both had an easy time doing so. The books eventually got to us :) I hope this year is a bit quicker with shipping. I really encourage my parents to utilize these cheap prices. I call it BOOK DAY when our orders come in and I get books for everyone so no one feels left out. Each month it is a BIG deal to get our scholastic book orders in! Thank you!

Very Satisfied,MY CODE WOULDNT WORK SO I CALLED IN AND THEY WERE ABLE TO FIX IT!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"My confirmation page after my order was complete gave me an error message saying that it took too long to load and needed me to resubmit it, but when I refreshed the page, my order confirmation was there anyway.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"My customer # has changed, and the number of spaces for my customer # is different than what is on the envelope.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,My customer number is not the same number I've used for the last 35 years??????,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"My only problem is the shipping fee with paper orders under $25.  I teach at a school with lower income families and very few are able to buy books, and when a couple do, then I'm left to pay the shipping which is not fully fair.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,N/A,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Na,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Nice to see everything is running smooth,TRUE
Very Satisfied,not buying today but usually do just compiling a list so hopefully family can buy books.  love your site- thank you!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,not complete with my order. Did find letters for parents. Love them,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"On the mobile app, I was trying to add the ""READS"" free book, but the ""confirm and apply"" button was below the screen and I couldn't scroll far enough to be able to click it. On the computer it worked fine.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,Opened site and prepared for my children to choose their options. Very likely to come back. I remember being SO excited for Book Fairs and Book Clubs as a kid in school. It was definitely a highlight of elementary and even middle school!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Ordered 2 Lego Ninjago Activity book.  Mrs Gugg9sbergm sent only one home.  Sending note to teacher tomorrow.  Thanks,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Pretty slick being able to add in the item number from the book order to add to my cart! Did not have to search very far for the items I wanted to purchase!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Prices are too high. Not willing to pay $6-8 for a paperback book.,TRUE

Very Satisfied,Really appreciate the service you offer children.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Shipping is wonderful this new school year in the Fall.  Seems like the bugs are worked out.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Site is easy to navigate. However, I did not see the bonus catalog section. I will look when I submit order on Wednesday.  Thanks for the $1.00 book section. helps me with birthday books and holiday books.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Site worked great! The search function under the site search was a little confusing since it only had the ""add to cart"" button there instead of going to the item to view the descrip. I get the idea of it, just wasn't prepared for it. This is so much easier than filling out those awful newsprint, tiny order forms lol",TRUE
Very Satisfied,So easy that I didn't even need to watch the tutorial. Thank you!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Some of the digital flyers would not load to view.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Some of the item #'s on the catalog page didn't match the online #'s. No big deal though, I searched by name and got them quickly.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Some trouble logging in - didn't accept password, but overall easier than usual.  As I've said before your site doesn't do well with Mozilla and other browsers that focus on privacy which is annoying as I have to use chrome or edge - whichever will work that day.  Also, my biggest pain is trying to enter the due dates.  Often the Drop-down calendar will not register my date.  It would be preferable to have an option to type in a date.  Thank you - hoping things are running more smoothly this year.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,Still plan to submit an order but wanted to verify the books in my cart my child.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,The digital flyer wouldn't always come up,TRUE

Very Satisfied,This site seems to work very well. I DO wish that when I chose my free $5.00 book that I would have been given the option to choose the book OR make an additional donation to the donation area. Spread even more of the love!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,This visit to the site was to get a game plan for which books I will be purchasing within a day or so...I just didn't purchase any at this moment.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"This was the fastest, EASIEST book order I have ever completed.  I usually have to call you to have somebody WALK ME through the process, but this time--------it was a CHARM!!  Sooooo-keep up the good work!!  (Of having an order form that flows logically!!)",TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Took a long time to load, just closed the page and re-opened it about an hour later and all is good.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,Trying to make a payment,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Using the site is simple, which I can appreciate!",TRUE
Very Satisfied,very well placed categories ans recommendations. Only feedback is that when I was on a recommendation page I liked 2 books and I clicked on 1 to add to cart but after that I couldnot go back to the same recommendation page and missed the second book I had liked. I then had to search for it again.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Waiting for teachers book list and will be buying. And getting some for my friends’ kids. I’m so excited.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Was a little overwhelming to sort through the flyers and try to present options to my kindergartner, but got it done!",TRUE

Very Satisfied,will enter order soon - just waiting to see if my mom wants to order anything too,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Wish entire book orders could arrive at the same time. I get partial orders for some kids, and it’s hard to send fulfilled orders home with just some kids, and partial orders with others. I try to keep partial orders until I have all their books, but have to refer to the order history online to see if their order is complete or if there are more coming.  Takes a bit more time to,cross check the orders.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,Wish it would let me order for my 8th grader and just send them home or to the school.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,"Wish SBC would reinstate delivery to home, again.  It would make this book fairy's life easier, but I can work it out with the teachers.",TRUE
Very Satisfied,Wish there was a way to edit a letter to attach to the student flyers.      Such as fonts and size.  I can't figure that out.,TRUE
Very Satisfied,would like to see individual book options if they are also in a pack: otherwise we end up with duplicates. thanks!,TRUE
Very Satisfied,Would not let me enter free book selection on a $176.00 order.,TRUE
