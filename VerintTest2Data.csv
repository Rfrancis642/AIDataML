Disappointed,"After my order as a parent, the email gave me a link to check the status of my order.   However, I an unable to find anywhere on this site where I can do that!",,
Disappointed,cannot find where to add my child's class code to my account,,
Disappointed,Changing teacher is a nightmare on site.,,
Disappointed,"Everytime I chat with someone, they end the chat before I can even respond. It is very frustrating. It happened just now with Yvonne and has happened each time I have chatted with someone on several occasions. They tell me their solution and then just end the chat. They don't even ask if there is anything else I need, or even provide a normal response time for me to respond each time they send a response or question to me. Can you please relay this along as customer service is getting a bad rep for this. Thanks so much.",,
Disappointed,"First, what the heck is the difference between a book fair and a book store? Why does it still look like I'm benefiting my niece's old school from past years, when I tried to sign up with my daughter's new school? Your flyers stopped loading for me after I'd looked at several. The cart doesn't have an easily visible total... I have to scroll all the way to the bottom, which feels like extra work when I just want to know where things stand before I add more books (or subtract some).",,
Disappointed,Get this woke crap off your site. The more woke stuff there is the less I buy. Shame.,,
Disappointed,"Historically, I find the Scholastic Book Club site very challenging to navigate",,
Disappointed,How do I enroll children with different teachers? I tried to a child to my account but was not asked for the teacher code.  I could not figure how to see a classroom wishlist,,
Disappointed,"I am a sub trying to place an order under the teachers name, however I couldn't do that successfully so I used my account from prior teaching.  So much hassle.",,
Disappointed,"I am unable to find books via searching. I searched for the title  ""Marcus Makes a Movie"" and the author ""Kevin Hart,"" among others and the books in your flyer did not come up. I used to work in a library so I know how to search books. I was able to use the item number, but it's absurd that using the titles of the book does not work. I am very disappointed with how poor your site operates.",,
Disappointed,"I can't find two students who placed an order.  My cart is empty, but it says I have two students who ordered.  I really hope this isn't a repeat of last year when I waited from Sept. to the end of Nov. for my first book order....",,
Disappointed,"I have been a member of scholastic for over 30 years. The quality of reading of your product has gone down, in my opinion. There are not enough classic stories, too many graphic novels, and silly stories (Dog man, etc..) and these kind of books do not make my students smarter readers. I know these are the type of books that sell, but , in my opinion, they lower Scholastic's standards.",,
Disappointed,I have not been able to intentionally get to a place to input the code from my flyer,,
Disappointed,I have now filled out the request for paper flyers twice. Please follow through and send them soon.,,
Disappointed,"I simply wanted to change the number of fliers I'm receiving since I have a larger class this year. The person I did chat with told me I needed to go the the ""arrow"". When I asked what arrow, she said scroll down to the bottom of the screen, for teachers, and select catalogs. There I find I need to order specific catalogs for a one-time order. I've been teaching 15 years and have placed scholastic orders each of those years. This didn't used to be so difficult.",,
Disappointed,"I struggling with ordering simply because there isn't enough variety.  I'd like to see more stable books offered instead of bandwagon books that don't last the test of time.  Also, the prices are so high parents don't even want me to bother with sending out class orders.  I always hope I'll find something for my classroom, but that is getting very hard to do anymore.",,
Disappointed,"I tried to submit my order yesterday.  When I clicked ""Submit Order"", it brought me back to the shopping cart but did not tell my why.  I tried multiple times, from different devices and it still wasn't working.  I then contacted costumer support via chat and the same thing was happening to that person.  She told me she'd put in a work order but I may not hear back for 2-3 days.  I decided to try again today and it did work.  This time, it gave me an error message in my cart telling me one of my items was out of stock.  I wish this error popped up yesterday so that I didn't have to spend my entire plan time trying to problem solve without luck.  Thankfully today it did work.",,
Disappointed,I USED to teach... now I'm a grandparent and just want to order books for my grandchild... the website keeps going back to my teacher account.  FRUSTRATING!,,
Disappointed,Im disappointed in the selection of books for $1 or $2.  A book for $1 popped up on my screen but it took me to a completely different section by that author. Not what I wanted.    Last year was a nightmare with Scholastic.  I'm praying its not like that again.,,
Disappointed,It is hard to find the electronic wallet to add additional money.,,
Disappointed,It is just not user friendly. Lots of scrolling. and the information you're looking for is not really in the place you are looking for it to be in.,,
Disappointed,It will not add to my cart at all and I can't order.    I have a credit that I can't use.,,
Disappointed,It would not let me spend the $5 in free books. We picked a $2 book and a $3 book but it would not let me order the two books.,,
Disappointed,Make easier format to log in,,
Disappointed,Please allow for author searching and linking. Subjects as well. Sort filter features by price and reading level while I'm dreaming.,,
Disappointed,Scholastic has not been helpful......we are stilled owed books from last school year.,,
Disappointed,"Signing in to do book fairs vs bookclubs and then being a teacher in one school, having two kids in another, another kid in another, and then being the Book Fair chair for a different school. It's so difficult! I've already messaged for assistance.",,
Disappointed,"The links provided on the flyer didn’t work. I had to search and find the site , navigation was frustrating.",,
Disappointed,The process of entering my students new teacher took more time than it should have and finally someone had to do it that works for scholastic.  It should be a simple process to change teachers at the beginning of the new year.,,
Disappointed,The website is very difficult to navigate to find where to add funds to my childrens account for shopping at their book fair in person.  Links from the email just direct to the log in page and don’t get to where you are trying to go.  It would be nice to have a feature that would provide a link for family members to fund their book shopping account as well.,,
Disappointed,"This was my second order and I thought, based on total dollars spent and the information presented, that the order qualified for $10 free books and a free group of books. I continued to choose the $10 in free books only to be charged the $10. After going back to the beginning several times, I realized I should read the small print that said the freebies were only once between August and September. If a teacher already utilized this freebie, it should not pop up and give an alert about this reward. Little hurdles like this when ordering seem to frustrate teachers. Make order user friendly please.",,
Disappointed,Took forever to find the spot to enter my child's classroom code. Almost gave up and didn't order anything.,,
Disappointed,VERINT TEST,,
Disappointed,"Very frustrated-   Put $80 books in a cart, only to discover that's the ""retail side"" so I can't buy them from my son's class teacher book club.  Started over - picked $30 worth of goods, entered the READS promo code for free book and got no credit or option to pick a $5 book.  Forget it.",,
Disappointed,Very hard to find the link for parents and the school book order.,,
Disappointed,Very slow to load sign-in pages,,
Disappointed,"Very slow, site freezing.",,
Disappointed,"Why are you selling books that normalize harsh parenting methods that humiliate and shame children?  While browsing, I saw a book called ""David Gets in Trouble"" that showed a child on the cover sitting in a corner.  The 1950s called and they would like their degrading treatment of children back.  Additionally, I saw you are selling the ""How Do Dinosaurs..."" series which also normalizes emotionally aggressive relationships between parents and children.  Families have problems, yes.  Please do not normalize parental mistreatment of children and CONDITIONAL (rather than unconditional) love.  Please sell books that depict healthy methods of parents guiding their children morally and ethically.  Children being mistreated by their parents don't always realize that what their parents are doing is not healthy.  Normalizing harsh parenting through literature does not help.  It can take years for children to realize that their parents mistreated them and they should not repeat the same patterns",,
Disappointed,"You were out of stock on over $80 worth of books towards my order. Now I have to contact all the parents and have them  write new checks, pick out new books  or discuss options. It is not a good look for the first few weeks of school. Also, I lose out on bonus points and book picks!",,
Neutral,a little confusing which program is which and where to go to just order and look at books,,
Neutral,"After selecting a book description, it's difficult to get back to the page where you can select a different flyer.    I would prefer more individual books instead of a pack of several.",,
Neutral,Always have a little trouble submitting my free book selection,,
Neutral,Book fair is tomorrow and my son's school does not come up.  I want to get him an eWallet but your system will not allow it without a book fair to tie it to...,,
Neutral,cant search for a book,,
Neutral,Code READS is not working. About to just not bother and not order these books.,,
Neutral,Could not get the site to work on the Chrome browser even with cookies unblocked.,,
Neutral,difficult to figure out where to make changes to account.  Site not clear.,,
Neutral,"Even after typing in the title of the book that I was looking for, the site took a long time to find the item.",,
Neutral,Finding my class information (i.e. when a due date is) has been a little difficult to find.,,
Neutral,"For books that are part of a series, I wish you would say which number it is. As an example, I know my son likes The Bad Guys, but I don't know which numbers you have for sale.",,
Neutral,"Had been calling to clarify my order. Still missing a book I ordered back on May 20, 2022.  I did not appreciate that a call back was never made from Scholastic.  I had to log in, call, send a message and finally, took me submitting a chat before I had my questions answered.",,
Neutral,Had trouble going back to the $1.00 page : D,,
Neutral,Hard to find information. Video tutorials would be nice.,,
Neutral,Hard to search for books.,,
Neutral,how about some tutorial videos on how to...?,,
Neutral,"However,  in the drop down menu to select the teacher, the teacher's name was not listed. It would be great if we could type in the name when the name is not available to select.",,
Neutral,I am not able to find the scholastic code for families to use online to shop from my classroom,,
Neutral,I am not getting notified when a parent makes an order.  I have called about this issue and it does not get resolved.  I do get an email when the box is on its way.  But i need to know when a parent places an order,,
Neutral,"I am not so sure how to enter my students and get flyers to parents. I am going to ask a coworker to help, who has used the site this year.",,
Neutral,I am sad that there are no longer packs of 10 books for $10.  I used these packs for all students to get a free book.,,
Neutral,"I am truly not trying to sound negative or that I'm complaining, but your website is incredibly difficult to navigate. There are WAY to many things to look on every page that I go to. Perhaps student orders can show up as JUST their names with a drop down option if you want to see what they've ordered? I don't know... it's just really challenging every time I come to this site. Like I said, I'm NOT trying to complain... I LOVE children's books and I LOVE promoting them. I just have a really hard time on your website. Thank you",,
Neutral,I am unable to figure out how to submit an order.,,
Neutral,"I am unsure if I sent the email to parents. I was in the middle of adding students and I was told that my time expired. However, when entering names, I thought I could download the list but I saw that all those names came up as one student. Then, I could not delete my error so I had to continue and add students  one at a time. This involved typing name, clicking add, having to click in box again to type another name., etc. Then time expired and I do not know what students I have listed.   I did not continue because it would take more time.    I did share the SBC to 2 of our new colleagues. I hope they do not get discouraged.",,
Neutral,I appreciated the pop-up to add items directly to the cart from the home page.,,
Neutral,I can't find filters and I wanted to filter by price.,,
Neutral,I could not find the sheet or a sheet to send home as a parent letter with my teacher code on it. None of the paper flyers had a sales sheet attached.,,
Neutral,I couldn't find the place to select my $10 in free books :(,,
Neutral,I did have difficulty finding my teacher.  I was wondering if you ship to homes instead?,,
Neutral,I did not see my ewallet for the fair tomorrow,,
Neutral,"I don't think it's the most user friendly site. Also, I don't appreciate how Scholastic has raised the price so much that most of our families can't afford to get the books anymore.",,
Neutral,"I entered a discount code as offered and instructed, but it did not take.",,
Neutral,"I find that I often get redirected to the teacher store, when all I want is to order books through the book orders. I saw the flyers advertising a lot of 6 books for $7.00, which is so helpful for my book clubs, and I was just trying to see what other titles were offered in that same deal. It was hard to find that.",,
Neutral,"I find the site has not been updated in 3 years, since I was last in the classroom. It is not the most user-friendly to maneuver in between the teacher wish list and book selecting. I wish multiple books could be added at once instead of one at a time.     It would be nice to have received physical copies of flyers.",,
Neutral,I found the books i want to order and i love the weekly $1 book.  i intend on placing my order on friday,,
Neutral,"I had a student send a check and an order, like they're supposed to.  One of the items he ordered is apparently out of stock.  Instead of a backorder sheet of stickers, it won't even let me place that order.  Now I've had to email his parents and ask if they want me to send the check back to be re-done or if I should choose a new $6 book.  Thanks for adding extra work on my plate Scholastic.",,
Neutral,I had to reload the page 3 times as a weird box kept coming up. I need to have flyers sent to me as I never got any and would like to make a class order. I can't find how to have flyers sent on your website.,,
Neutral,I had trouble figuring out why I was about to pay shipping and why I couldn't find some books my daughter wanted.,,
Neutral,"I had trouble finding where to submit my child’s teacher & when I found it, my entire cart was deleted so I had to start over. It would be better if the scholastic site worked seamlessly with the school classroom pages.",,
Neutral,I had trouble viewing the digital flyer.,,
Neutral,I have an account but do not know how to enter class code,,
Neutral,"I have been using Scholastic for years and I am currently having a difficult time recommending books to my kindergarten families.  The prices have increased tremendously, while the selection has decreased.  I'm hoping that you will offer most books in the $3 - $4 range with a few choices in the $2 range.  You are also offering books in packs, but not offering the titles separately.  I won't buy the pack when I already have most titles.",,
Neutral,I have parents who place book orders after I have submitted the order.  It is less than 12 hours after I have done so and the parents are told their child's order will be shipped in October.  He then calls and is on the phone for over 30 minutes.  Why do you make it so difficult to place orders?  My class order is still processing so why is it even an issue?    Please email me.  I had another parent place an order a day later.  Will that order be sent with my class order?,,
Neutral,"I like to view the flyers because it is easier to pick out titles I might be interested in purchasing.  The site was having issues and the flyers weren't coming up to view.  It was frustrating so I gave up and will try again later.  Also, I know inflation is causing everything to go up, but it is disappointing to see the once $1 books in each grade level flyer continues to go up.  I work at a Title I school and it is nice to see books that ALL kids can afford.  I usually purchase a large number of these deal books to give away in my library each month.  Now that chapter books cost $3+ I will not be able to purchase as many to give away.  I understand Scholastic is a business, but it is a little disappointing.",,
Neutral,I liked that both children's orders were combined into one billing transaction. However both children should have had the ability to take advantage of the READ free book code. But only one child was able to select a free book.,,
Neutral,"I ordered some books for my younger son because his teacher sent home a book order. So I connected him to his teacher's class. I then did the same with my older son because he wanted some books as well, but his teacher never actually gave us a book order or mentioned that she was putting one in.  I was just able to find her name in the website when I went to connect him to a teacher. Today, my younger son came home with his book order, but my older son did not. My older son's order still just says ""Submitted to teacher."" Is there something else that I need to do?",,
Neutral,"I put items in my cart, but the site would not let me log in so I could buy the books I wanted to purchase. I had an account last year and my grandson s now in first grade, so i need to chanfge classrooms, which i did, but then I could not log in. I tried to create a new account, but could not do that either. I am not impressed with your website a the moment.",,
Neutral,"I read the tutorial, but found it a little difficult to navigate the site and look at books. After I ordered I realized there were a LOT more books to choose from than I had seen. Oh well, next time. The prices are good. Not all books had a description of the story",,
Neutral,I remember being a kid and loving scholastic book days when I got to buy books to read! While it's not exactly the same I did have fun going through the flyer with my son and picking out books he thought were interesting!,,
Neutral,"i searched the graphic novel of i survived the attacks of september 11, 2001 and nothing came up",,
Neutral,I started ordering under my name and it didn't automatically connect me with my son's teacher. I had to notice the price difference to the flyer and then went into the club section and was able to get the pricing I had for the flyer.,,
Neutral,I still appreciate the tactile sense of browsing the printed Scholastic book order flyer.,,
Neutral,"I struggled with the bundled options, its not easy to see details about each book.  Picture shows 4 books when there are 5- its a bit confusing.",,
Neutral,I think that it should be noted that teachers should wait to enter in all their students orders at once otherwise we loose bonus points.,,
Neutral,"I tried on my phone to enter a free book and submit my order,but it did not work so I went on my computer and tried and it worked.",,
Neutral,I wanted to see more books beyond my child's grade.  The options were confusing to figure out and looked like that same books over and over again.,,
Neutral,I was on the main website before I realized I had to click somewhere special to get to the order with my kiddo's teacher.,,
Neutral,I went to scholastic.com and it was not intuitive and difficult to find how to submit an order through my kid's teacher and use the fliers,,
Neutral,I wish the $1 books would come back. Some teachers can not afford to buy $75 worth of book before we can access the $1 books. Its hard enough to afford a $1 book for each of my students each month. I hate that I haven't been able to provide my students with more book this last year like I did my first year.,,
Neutral,I wish there were more hard cover books.,,
Neutral,"I would appreciate an easier way to look at the flyers...maybe in alphabetical list for with a picture of the book  beside each listing.    It would also be wonderful if there were more books available with a Christian theme, especially at Christmas and Easter.",,
Neutral,I would love to be able to search books by reading level (vs. age level).,,
Neutral,I'm ordering for my granddaughter.  I WILL order again!,,
Neutral,im still searching for books,,
Neutral,"It is just not easy to find things on your website. Since I work on line, I need to be ale to quickly and easily see if  my students have made orders so that I can submit them.  That is not an easy thing to find.",,
Neutral,It is still not easy to quickly find what I want and switch back and forth between items.,,
Neutral,It isn't easy to find my teacher's code so that I can order through her classroom.,,
Neutral,It takes time to find the interesting books we want to order.,,
Neutral,it was a pleasure to visit the website.,,
Neutral,"It was very hard to find the correct place to go. First, I was on the generic ""Scholastic"" website and while I connected to the school, I was not able to connect to my child's teacher. Shipping to the teacher's classroom didn't work. When I tried the chat feature for help, the session timed out and I never got help. I eventually found the correct ""Book Club"" site and entered books straight from the flyer from school.     So overall...tricky to navigate the website.",,
Neutral,It wasn't clear that to order online we had to connect to a teacher. We were given a code to use but no instructions so when entering the website it was a bit difficult to navigate.,,
Neutral,"It's frustrating to not be able to get the next book in a series. For example, the Wings of Fire. My daughter read the first one to see if she liked it but we don't want the set because we already have the first one. We just want the second book, but will have to get it somewhere else.  Thanks",,
Neutral,"It's not clear on your website for orders paid by check whether or not to include the paper order form.  Also, the Business Reply envelopes I'm sent with our flyer have the Scholastic Book Clubs' zip code as 45273-8504  The zip code on your website is different: 45263-0446 ... please correct.    ALSO ... why haven't we  received our regular paper flyers for October's order?",,
Neutral,It's really easy to fin books in this website.,,
Neutral,"Just hard to find something that I think she will enjoy, thats at her level. Shes 8 and a good reader but many books seem to young for her (picture books) and she doesn't enjoy graphic novels. I only want  to buy books that will get reread,  otherwise we just go to the local library  cheaper for me and less clutter at home.",,
Neutral,Just initial navigation is a little confusing,,
Neutral,Last year I stopped ordering because it was a mess.  If it goes back to the previous year I would love to use it again.  Plus all four kindergarten teachers had a bill for the whole school year and our PTO had paid it.  I gave you scores based on last year.,,
Neutral,Last year it took forever to get the books that is why I gave it a 6.  Faster to go to a bookstore or library.  however pre-covid I would have given a 10 as books were delivered FAST,,
Neutral,Letter to parents downloaded blank.,,
Neutral,Looking for a connection to order flyers  sent to my school.  In previous years they were automatically sent to my school.  This year they  were not. I would like flyers for Early Childhood and Firefly.,,
Neutral,make it easier to post a link so friends and family can buy my child books,,
Neutral,"Maybe I am just missing it, but I really wish I could find books by the skill level of the reader better. My son has dyslexia and isn't reading at his grade level, so it makes finding books for him on this site difficult.",,

Neutral,Seemed hard to search for books.,,
Neutral,"should be able to place books in ""shopping cart"" directly from the digital flyer. The numbers on the digital flyer are too small to easily read. Should be listed when click on the book.",,
Neutral,"Site was a little difficult to understand, originally did order through parent site, took me a little while to figure out I needed to check out on book club site so my child's teacher would get credit, would be easier if I could enter her classroom code on profile and it was automatically entered when I check out instead of trying to figure out which site I need to enter my order on. Very confusing.",,
Neutral,"Some book bundling deals are awkward and too pricey. Overall, the inventory sometimes feels limited on this site.",,
Neutral,"Some of the features on the website are a little difficult to manage on various devices--the popups (while helpful at times) often get in the way of the task at hand.  The website was very difficult to use on an iPad, but much better on a laptop.",,
Neutral,Sometimes the site is confusing to navigate between the clubs and regular inventory.,,
Neutral,still deciding what to order,,
Neutral,"Thank you for my latest order, we love the books! I was told that once the order ships I would receive an e-mail and could then call to have the tax removed. That has not yet happened. I also earned $10 in free books and a multipack preschool, that were both missing from the shipment.",,

Neutral,The survey popped up before I could complete what I was doing.,,
Neutral,"The website is sending my 4th grader's books to my 1st grader's teacher even though I signed them in and ordered separately using their own classroom codes.  It's not a huge deal for us because my kids will both get their books either way, but I really want each teacher to get the points for the right kid.  I'd also like my 4th grader to get his own order, because it's more fun to have them delivered to you in class instead of getting them later from your little brother.  Really  frustrating!",,

Neutral,Very slow to load,,
Neutral,"We enjoy ordering books from Scholastic but the wording of this survey has me wondering if anyone actually read through this before publishing it. The three Yes/No questions explain that you should answer Yes if your answer is No and No if your answer is Yes. I was unable to complete my task, was unable to submit an order and did experience difficulties. Based on the survey instructions, I have selected the opposite answers for each question.",,

Neutral,"When my account pulls up, it pulls up to my parent account.  I want it to pull up to my teacher account.  I guess I will have to cancel the parent account because otherwise I have to try to figure out how to see student orders- it's not very user friendly.    When you pull up the flyer view, it won't let you go to the next page if you zoom in to look at anything.

Neutral,"Your site is not easy to follow to order the books. I had to use the sheets that were sent home from the school and then search for each book using the item number. I was not impressed with the site. I would recommend the books, but I would also warn everyone about using the site.",,

Satisfied,"Below ,in this survey , you asked me if I need assistance ( which I don't ) , then my email was required regardless. Why?",,
Satisfied,Browsing to look at the books circled from flyer will come back to complete my order later.,,
Satisfied,Could improve selecting free books earned when checking out by adding photos of items,,
Satisfied,Couldn't figure out how to order the free book,,
Satisfied,Couldnt find an individual book to order. It was in books of 10s.,,
Satisfied,Diana finally help me get into the sight I needed. Thank you,,
Satisfied,Didn't place the order today because the due date is next week.,,
Satisfied,Discount code did not work chat bot told me to sign off and back on which was annoying,,
Satisfied,Don't know where to find the book listed?,,
Satisfied,DON'T SEE HOW TO SHARE FLYER WITH A PARENT,,
Satisfied,"Easy to add items to wish list and cart. Sometimes navigation is difficult (e.g., once get to checkout, it would be nice to have a back button ('back to shopping'), rather than using the browser back button or having to go back 'home' and navigate back to where I was before entering checkout).",,
Satisfied,Everything worked well.,,
Satisfied,Finding the Book Clubs for the correct codes to enter.. I feel like I switch between screens.. Scholastic regular vs after I sign in and it connects me to his class.,,
Satisfied,Flyer wouldn't load and clicking link still didn't work,,
Satisfied,Free book selection should be larger,,
Satisfied,"Good site, only slightly confusing part is ""oh wait I have to assign a student before I can buy"" but  it makes sense.",,
Satisfied,GREAT SITE ND VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND.,,
Satisfied,"I am a retired teacher and had an account of my own for my classroom. I now want to purchase books for my grandson's teacher but when I enter my email address, I am taken to my teacher account, and the site won't let me create a parent account. I don't want to purchase unless the teacher gets credit.",,
Satisfied,I am just browsing to see what is new and available.  I am the grandparent and will have the books shipped.,,
Satisfied,I am not sure that the entire process is intuitive but I am muddling through.,,
Satisfied,I am still a bit hesitant after last year's first order took over two months.  I shared with families this month but if orders do not come in within 2 weeks we will not send home to parents again.,,
Satisfied,I am surprised that my customer number was changed.  It was the same number for years.  Why did it change and did everything from my old account merge or do I have 2 accounts?,,
Satisfied,I am waiting to see if I get any more orders.,,
Satisfied,I believe I earned some free books but did not see a place to choose those books. This is the only time this has happened. I probably didn't see it.,,
Satisfied,I can’t find my class added to my profile yet.,,
Satisfied,I cannot print or download the parent letter.,,
Satisfied,"I could not print my printable teacher letter - I got a screen with ""bad response"" instead.  I opened it in an incognito window and it worked.",,
Satisfied,I couldn't add the free book from the mobile site it wouldn't let me scroll down to submit.  So i had to pull it up on my laptop to get the free book saved.,,
Satisfied,I couldn't send the order to the other teacher.  I have two kids in the school.,,
Satisfied,"I don't see many books on the home page of the website.  For overall browsing purposes, I prefer to flooded with options as a consumer.",,
Satisfied,"I entered the code on the header (READS), but when I tried to check out it says the code has expired.",,
Satisfied,I feel like there should be an easier search function,,
Satisfied,I had a hard time trying to change my password.,,
Satisfied,"I had a lot of problems with orders last year and was very frustrated with Scholastic.  I had a shipment get lost, a shipment go to a school I haven't taught at for 8 years, and shipping delays like crazy.",,
Satisfied,I had to put in my card info a couple of times before it would accept it - kept saying invalid code. I had to enter things in a certain order.,,
Satisfied,"I had to re-load the page and log in 3 times before the teacher information became available to me. It did not show that I was a teacher with orders waiting. It kept showing an empty cart. In the end, using the same log in that I had used twice before, it finally showed my teacher information and allowed me to order.   Having said that, I still LOVE Scholastic.  You have been a mainstay of my classroom for so many years - I don't know what I'd do without you. 3",,
Satisfied,"I had to search around to find where to enter the class code but other than that, the visit to your site was seamless.",,
Satisfied,I have asked for a 4th grade flyer but have not received one- most of my parents need the paper flyer,,
Satisfied,"I have not ordered anything for 3 yrs.  I was not teaching reading.  I am again now.  So, setting up my acct.   Lost all my Bonus Points.  sad...",,
Satisfied,I hope the shipping issues are resolved.,,
Satisfied,"I like being able to see tons and tons of books, but I wish there was an option to search based on price and not by grade or age. I really like the selection of suggested books at the bottom of the page after you click on a book. I feel like there are so many books I am missing and struggle to be able to search appropriately on my phone.",,
Satisfied,I like that the Scholastic website is easy to navigate and use. Look forward to things returning back to normal after the supply chain issues and the pandemic.,,
Satisfied,I logged in today because I didn't receive my October catalogs.  So I'm requesting them now.  I figured they would be sent out automatically each month!!!,,
Satisfied,I need a tax exempt button,,
Satisfied,I need to make my status inactive.  I do not need any flyers right now and need to stop them from being mailed to me at my school.,,
Satisfied,I started out on the Scholastic page and it took me a while to realize I need the Book Clubs page.,,
Satisfied,"I think it's great that we can select a child's name when we have multiple children in the Scholastic System. I like that feature in the cart and the ability to add to their wishlist. The struggle that I have with that, is that when earning free books, we may spend $25 on each child, but we would still only receive one free book. It makes it more effective for me to submit two orders so they can each pick their own free book, but I know it's more costly for you.     In addition, the books and series that my children like most were out of stock. That prompted me not to submit an order today. It seems that the books or series that my children want (and within a price range I am willing to spend with each book order) always seem to be out of stock.",,
Satisfied,I think there should be a way to import emails from google so that teachers don't have to manually enter them all in!,,
Satisfied,I thought this was pretty straight forward. My only thing was that it took me a moment to find the button to see all books in the age group I selected rather than just a sample of what was available. Once I saw that link everything else was easy.,,
Satisfied,I tried to find a book with a general description.  I was looking for a wipe-off book for help with the alphabet and numbers.,,
Satisfied,I tried to pull up the2nd & 4th grade flyers to view. they never came up even after I clicked the help if  having trouble,,
Satisfied,I want to know how to get flyers,,
Satisfied,I wanted the option to share my child's wish list with family.,,
Satisfied,I wanted to use bonus points to buy a book but the system charged instead of using the bonus points. I ended up deleting the book.  Hopefully I can order it with the bonus points next month.,,
Satisfied,I was interested in many of the book packs but already own 1 or 2 in most of them and wish the titles that you were interested in were available to purchase on their own.,,
Satisfied,I was just checking my parent online orders. They are due by tomorrow…and I will submit together then.,,
Satisfied,"I was looking for a way to request paper, book order catalogs to hand out to my students.",,
Satisfied,I was surprised by the price of the books!  Yikes!,,
Satisfied,I was unable to find the book packs listed on the cover pages of the flyers sent to me.  I wasn't sure where to find them.   It was also difficult to see the text when I was viewing sample pages.  Sometimes I was able to get it to zoom in on the words by moving my mouse over and sometimes it would not.   It was also frustrating to have to keep clicking on the see full details button to read a description of the story.,,
Satisfied,"i wasn't able to find a way to search by topic, like self regulation.  I just had to hope it came up.  You should have a tab for kids on spectrum.  Maybe you do but it wasn't obvious.",,
Satisfied,I wish it was easier to use bonus points.,,
Satisfied,I wish that scholastic carried adult books.,,
Satisfied,I wish that you could also search for books by price.  I often have money to spend (earned rewards) and sometimes difficult to spend the exact amount.  Being able to search by price would help with this process.,,
Satisfied,"I wish the digital flyers were just a webpage.  The flyers behave weirdly and I kept finding myself places I hadn't intended to be.  Also, they are very small and hard to read.",,
Satisfied,I wish the discount books were for teachers who didn't have to spend $75.  It would benefit my class who are limited to ordering books due to budgets!,,
Satisfied,I wish there are more and better options in the Bonus Catalog.,,
Satisfied,"I wish there was a way to search or sort by price. For example, as a parent (or a teacher) looking to build my library on a tight budget, I'd love to search for all the $5 and under books. Or knowing that Scholastic has dollar deals, all the $2 books.",,
Satisfied,I wish you could see a photo of the books that are available with the code READS (Because apparently I literally want to judge a book by it's cover??).,,
Satisfied,I wish you would not charge tax (just have it already added in the book price). Also I miss getting a receipt with my order.,,
Satisfied,I work in the school library and would like to have the links to several age group flyers available in the email that gets auto created.,,
Satisfied,I would like to have the option to ship my order/books to my home address.,,
Satisfied,"I would love the flyers to be sent out again. It is a great way to help those purchase books, by seeing the item.",,
Satisfied,I would love to get more Spanish Scholastic order forms for my class since it is a Bilingual/ Dual Immersion class. Thank you!,,
Satisfied,I would love to see Reading Group Book sets for lower GRL levels A-D.,,
Satisfied,I would say not a huge difficulty but I had to reset my password and felt like I had to log in multiple times (2 or 3?) to complete the order. Not a huge problem but slightly annoying.,,
Satisfied,"I'd love Free shipping, or some bonus to get free shipping.  I can't control whether many of my students order books or not.  With a $25 minimum, I have to send the book orders home less often to be sure more kids order books, so that I don't have to pay for shipping.  I'm just not willing to spend my money to pay shipping for my students' books.    Maybe there could be a minimum order amount for individual families to order and have it sent to school or home??",,
Satisfied,"If connect to the teacher, should not require sign up process.",,
Satisfied,If it is possible to look at books by theme a little easier it would be nice.,,
Satisfied,"I'm always checking back on the site for new reading packs in our spanish classrooms.  We need more ""ready to read"" books for grades TK-3rd.",,
Satisfied,I'm disappointed by the quality of some of the titles and the lack of low price books.  I think the selection has decreased over the past few years.,,
Satisfied,"I'm still learning how to navigate to what I need. Sometimes, it's not as intuitive as I'd like. Overall, I've had a positive experience with the site.",,
Satisfied,"It can be hard to find books even with the search feature.  For instance I typed in ""Babysitters Club"" and it only offered me the 5 book pack, but I knew there was an individual book available.",,
Satisfied,It is annoying to me that the site works best in landscape over portrait on my iPad. I usually forget to turn it.,,
Satisfied,"It is difficult to get to the correct page---the clubs.scholastic is not easy to find just by Googling ""Scholastic"".  That would be my only recommendation is to make the clubs easier to navigate to from the main page.",,
Satisfied,"It is hard to find the book club site versus the regular scholastic site.  Going forward, I believe I figured it out, but why separate the two so distinctly?  Thanks!",,
Satisfied,It just took me a while to find the dollar section that was available to me.  I hope that the books do not take as long as last year to arrive!,,
Satisfied,it logged me out after a few minutes of inactivity but once i logged back in all my items were still in my shopping cart,,
Satisfied,It timed out and did not keep what I had done. I had to re-enter everything.,,
Satisfied,"It was difficult to access the dollar books, even though I had earned them.  Also tough to gain access to the visa funds I had from last year.",,
Satisfied,"It was difficult to find a ""free book"".  The one I chose for $5, the website said was not eligible.  Don't know why it wasn't.",,
Satisfied,It was hard to get to the flyers but overall it was a good visit!,,
Satisfied,"It would be great if teachers/parents could search by price (for example in the search bar enter ""$1"" and all the $1 books came up)",,
Satisfied,It would be great if you could search by lexile/reading level.  Or even if you could easily access flyers from other grades as my child is reading above her grade level.,,
Satisfied,It would be great if you had a way to sort by price or browse for books below a certain price point.,,
Satisfied,It would be helpful if we could see the titles of all books that are in book bundles before placing the order. I did not order the unicorn diaries bundle today because I couldn't read what titles were included.,,
Satisfied,It would be helpful to be able to search by price. I would like to have more classic titles.,,
Satisfied,"It would be nice to be able to easily share a child's wishlist, with easy connection to the teacher's  class code#.",,
Satisfied,It would be nice to shop by flyer without having to download every flyer,,
Satisfied,It wouldn't let me enter my $5 free book.,,
Satisfied,it wouldn't let me sign in,,
Satisfied,It’s difficult to swipe right and see all the books in a category.,,
Satisfied,Its a good store like amazon and for school and the books are cheep,,
Satisfied,It's hard to find the exact books on the teacher's list.,,
Satisfied,"It's my first time on the site and I really enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't like was that it did not let me know what the delivery time would look like. Overall, it's a nice and self-explanatory site.",,
Satisfied,"It's not clear when we will receive the book? With online orders, I like to know when to check back in in case something gets lost.",,
Satisfied,It's not user friendly unless you are knowledgeable with the site,,
Satisfied,I've struggled for years with the cc payment method on this site. Mostly around saving a cc/adding a new cc.,,
Satisfied,Just a low stock issue for one book the child wanted. I think you should take low stock out if we can't order them.,,
Satisfied,Just checking out availability of some titles before I make purchase soon,,
Satisfied,Just deleting names from my contact list...it didn't transfer over nicely or communicate with google well.,,
Satisfied,Just still looking for where to do this. :),,
Satisfied,"Just that a book was ""out of stock""",,
Satisfied,Keep me logged in once I log in,,
Satisfied,Kept freezing on the flyer's.,,
Satisfied,"Last year when the orders arrived, each child's order was printed on a tear apart slip. This made it easy and efficient to sort large orders and ensure that all of the correct books were sent with each child. We also were able to send this slip with the books as a receipt showing the parent that they had received all we have record of them ordering,    This order I received had three pages of books listed and some of the student orders were in different places on different pages,    If possible, the tear apart slips or a place online to reference the orders would be great!  Thanks for all you do,  Melanie Coffelt",,
Satisfied,Looking for graphic novels to try and interest a young boy to read.,,
Satisfied,My child's teacher was listed at her former school. I let her know so she can update it.,,
Satisfied,"My daughter is in a dual language program at school.  She has half the day in spanish. I wish that the Leo flier was more often. I know it used to be almost every month. Now  (unless that has changed this year)  it is only twice a year.  I think you should market your Leo flier to teachers that are DLI. Spanish books are more expensive (in my experience) and most of my child's teachers are new since the program is new to our school.  Also, I have really noticed that the prices on everything have gone up. I suppose it is due to the state of the world, but it makes me sad.",,
Satisfied,"My school is not the right school, even though it's the right teacher.",,
Satisfied,My students really like the paper flyers but we have not received any this school year.  Will they be sent in the future?,,
Satisfied,N/A,,
Satisfied,Need to make sure that I will be receiving my flyers at my site this year for each month. They did not come directly to me but came in bundles with other schools from the district in it. I often missed the flyers altogether because they never arrived at our site and I would have to call scholastic to send the flyers directly to me and that took a few days for them to arrive.,,
Satisfied,none,,
Satisfied,None at this time,,
Satisfied,Not all books are available that are available on the regular website of scholastic,,
Satisfied,"Not difficulties per se, but the website doesn't always feel intuitive for figuring out how to do what I need as a teacher. This is only my second year, so maybe that's why.",,
Satisfied,not enough books displayed on a page when looking at fiction books.  Too many pages to click through.,,
Satisfied,Not enough non-fiction or STEM related books selections,,
Satisfied,"not hard, but not very easy finding the right flyer to order the books",,
Satisfied,"Not many parents are ordering books anymore.  I used to have huge book orders in the past.  Since my class didn't order 25 dollars worth, I missed out on the great coupon offers.  I don't want to add my own money to orders in order to get 10 dollars free.  Possibly add a 5 dollars free to the classroom that is under the 25 dollar mark.",,
Satisfied,"Not really a difficulty, but I would have liked to be able to specify ""grandparent"" rather than parent.",,
Satisfied,"once i find this site it's ok.  but there are like two scholastic sites that i can't differentiate and i can't find the books on one of them, but they are almost exactly alike.  i hate that.",,
Satisfied,One of my students did not get a book she ordered.,,
Satisfied,"One of the sets of books that a student wanted to order is out of stock. I will check back later. It is the Who would win, rumble 6 pack. Item number 42G1 for $22.",,
Satisfied,Out of stock items should be able to be ordered and then I can be updated when they are available and shipped.  Not telling me to check back later.,,
Satisfied,Overall good experience.  I felt like the book recommendations were a bit on the young side.,,
Satisfied,"Overall, a good experience however the prices are a little high!",,
Satisfied,Please add filters to narrow down search. Grade/Price/theme all on same page.,,
Satisfied,sad that scholastic got rid of the 50 cents cheaper when ordering online,,
Satisfied,search engine could use some improvement,,
Satisfied,Sign in period is too short.  Most times when browsing I need to come back and find I've been signed out.  It's just annoying to sign back in is all.,,
Satisfied,"Since the pandemic, I have not been getting the student flyers sent to school.  I REALLY want them to generate more orders.  PLEASE send them to school.  I emailed last year and sat on hold for a time to talk to a Rep about this and still have not received the paper flyers.",,
Satisfied,"so so difficulty. It would be nice if when entering the free $5 book code, it would change the $5 book already on your order into the free book, rather than requiring you to enter the free book again and deleting the $5 book on your order.",,
Satisfied,Some books are not competitively priced and are cheaper on amazon- so I will always check if they are not 2.00 or more I'll buy from scholastic but sometimes you are 5.00 more and I can't justify it.,,
Satisfied,"Some item numbers didn’t match the flyers, but overall, easy to shop and place my order!",,
Satisfied,Some of the wording prices were overlapping. I couldn't read what was written in these areas.,,
Satisfied,Some parts wouldn't load. It would also be nice if you could add to cart straight from the brochure page,,
Satisfied,Sometimes I find it hard to locate the collection deals or the book of the week sale,,
Satisfied,Sometimes the digital flyers would not load and I would have to keep refreshing the page. Other than that I am a big Scholastic fan and love ordering books!,,
Satisfied,"Still getting used to using the online, but I was not able to get back to the teachers list after I chose some books. Not sure if that's a user issue but I wish there was a visible tab to get back to that after making selections and checking my cart to see what my total was at. my intention was to spend 25 and then spend the $5 on a book for the teacher and I could figure out where her requests were.",,
Satisfied,Super disappointed the shark book is out of stock.  I did not see any information as to when it might be available again.  Super sad 5 year old.,,
Satisfied,The $10 to spend right now window was not available and I couldn't complete my order,,
Satisfied,"The book that I wanted to order is out of stock.  No details as to when it will be back in stock.  Usually, companies would send you information when the item is back in stock.  Disappointed.",,
Satisfied,the books are more expensive than Amazon,,
Satisfied,The button to SEE ALL in a section doesn't stand out easily,,
Satisfied,The coupon code for a free book expired before the book order is even due. That’s frustrating!,,
Satisfied,the email that is associated with my account isn't a valid email for some reason.  i could't change my forgotten password because the email isn't correct.,,
Satisfied,the flyers are glitchy,,
Satisfied,"The hover behavior where it opens a dialog when you're in the catalog view is a little weird, but it works.    Tried to search for ""how it's built"" books, and the search definitely seems like it could use improvement. No results for ""sailboat"" even though there's a sailboat book in there.",,
Satisfied,The only difficulty I had was switching to my daughters account vs my son's account.,,
Satisfied,The only difficulty is shopping or making Teacher Selections by level. I wish there was a way to search books by reading level.,,
Satisfied,The page was slow to load. Not sure if it was the website or my computer though.,,
Satisfied,The price used to be 50 cents less on line. Disappointed that they are the same price now.,,
Satisfied,The scroll side bar is so skinny to move.  I hope shipping timeline has improved to pre pandemic schedule.,,
Satisfied,"The search functions are a little antiquated, but I was able to complete, thanks!",,
Satisfied,"The site is pretty easy to get around on.  I do like that you tell us right away if a book is out of stock.  Then we can just let the families know, and there is not this long wait time, like last year.  Thank you!",,
Satisfied,The way the free book code needed to be entered was a bit confusing. I ended up ordering two copies of the same book.,,
Satisfied,"The website (and this could be operator error) would get stuck as I was trying to place the orders.  It would not let me scroll down the list of the catelog to check certain books.  I had to refresh and then it let me scroll down.  Otherwise, I like the option of being able to look at the flyer and having items shipped to my home so that they are not lost at the school. or if we need to go virtual with the pandemic.  Thank you for making these changes.  I have always loved Scholastic book club.",,
Satisfied,"There was a $1 books offer that opened to me, but when I switched pages I couldn't find it again. I was going to go back and get some but couldn't access it easily. Otherwise no problems.",,
Satisfied,Took me awhile.  Not super user friendly.,,
Satisfied,Tracking #’s would be appreciated,,

Satisfied,"trying to figure out how many bonus points I have  *thank you for all the great prices, bonuses, shipping :)",,
Satisfied,trying to update my grade level to kindergarten so I could share the link with parents. I used the chat feature and the associate checked it for me. It was kindergarten on one screen but still said 1st on the other. Associate checked and confirmed profile on your side and suggested I clear my cache on my end.,,
Satisfied,unsure how to submit student paper order with ease. Also thought it was silly there is a shipping limit. Should be free shipping for all,,
Satisfied,"We really wanted to purchase individual titles of the Owl Diaries, but they were not available.",,
Satisfied,We used to have a warehouse right in our community.  When it shut down last year the delay on getting books WAS HUGE!  I decided not to order last year.  I am going to try again and hope that parents get their orders sooner than later.,,
Satisfied,"When a book is out of stock, i should be able to put in on a watchlist or something.",,
Satisfied,When searching for books to add the site often lags.,,
Satisfied,When selecting free books it would be nice to see the covers and authors.,,
Satisfied,"When selecting my free $10.00 credit, it would be nice if I could limit my search  with a specific dollar amount. It would save a lot of time.  Thank you for your consideration.",,
Satisfied,"When used the promotion ""READS"" to get a free book for an order over $25, I was unable to search for titles. For example, I would type in ""pete"" for pete the cat books, however the search revealed no results. However when I deleted the title and just selected ""kindergarten"" grade, pete the cat books appeared as possible options.",,
Satisfied,Where do I mail my payment,,
Satisfied,Will be placing order later today,,
Satisfied,will be processing order on Sunday waiting for a few more parents to order,,
Satisfied,Wondered what to do about out of stock orders.  I plan to return the student's money,,

Satisfied,Would like to order individual books from the black is beautiful 5 pack,,
Satisfied,Would like to see more options for using points.,,
Satisfied,Would perfer a long list (with pictures) of the books you offer. Categorizing them doesn't always make things easier. I kept seeing the same 15 books. Sure there are more.,,
Satisfied,Yesterday I submitted a student online order and mailed a student order and today I had another student online order. Since my orders were submitted on different days I was not able to receive any bonus points or rewards. Is there any way to get those credits?,,
Very Disappointed,"Added items to the general scholastic purchasing site.  however, didn't know this wouldn't link me to the book clubs directly.  book clubs has a lot fewer options.  ended up buying at amazon.",,
Very Disappointed,"After the multiple poor experiences I had last year, I am not participating in book orders in my classroom this year.",,
Very Disappointed,And where’s the pre-k or early childhood site? I tried to order but I was told by the website that I was wrong,,
Very Disappointed,cant find teacher and no code,,
Very Disappointed,Congratulations- my new password for this site contains the words This is stupid.  I have been a parent ordering books for almost 10 years and the absolutely ridiculous crap I had to go through to log back in after forgetting my password was exceedingly frustrating.  What a waste of my time.  Next time I will go to the bookstore or library to get my kids’ books.  The drive will take less time.  I couldn’t even complete my order before this stupid survey popped up.,,
Very Disappointed,dogs are cute,,
Very Disappointed,"Every time I add a book to cart, I get a pop-up that says added to cart, but then the cart is still empty.",,
Very Disappointed,"Good lord, where do I put the class code in?  This is ridiculous.",,
Very Disappointed,Hard to follow….almost made me quit the purchase…also should have option to purchase as a guest and give paypal option,,
Very Disappointed,I am frankly disgusted by Scholastic's false promises of free books for teachers.  I am far to busy to waste my time on nonsense.  I will inform my classroom parents that Scholastic has repeatedly failed to uphold its promises to reward teachers with free books for student purchase therefore I will no longer distribute monthly book order forms.  They can go to retail book shops in the future.,,
Very Disappointed,I am frustrated that the last two orders I made were canceled and not by me!  I choose to have our orders come to my home because we are within a high school that does not give us our mail.,,
Very Disappointed,"I am ordering $30 worth of books, the coupon ""READS"" still shows in the banner and I can not apply y free book.",,
Very Disappointed,"I can't add anything to my cart!  I click the black ADD TO CART button, and a pop-up says the item is added, but when I go to the cart it is empty.  This site is useless.",,
Very Disappointed,I couldnt use the READS coupon code.,,
Very Disappointed,"I hate having to create accounts for every website out there.  Why can't you just let us enter our information and make a purchase as a ""guest""?  I hate this so much that I have actually not made purchases from you in the past because of it, and I am undecided now if I'll make a purchase tonight.  I came to this website tonight with full intention of placing an order, but now I might not.",,
Very Disappointed,I have just placed my last order with your company.  You failed to honor your advertised rewards for teachers when students place orders.  I'm done with your company.  My time is too valuable to do your advertising for free.  No more!  Do not send me any more flyers.  I am done!,,
Very Disappointed,"I ran out of during this visit to the website, but I will be placing my order shortly. :)",,
Very Disappointed,I s till do not know how to submit an order with money brought to me by a student that is in cash - I have to pay out of pocket up front for this?,,
Very Disappointed,"I was going to order some books for my daughter per her preschool's request, as I have done countless times before, as this is for our 5th child.  I wanted to buy some Christian books in addition to secular ones.  When I typed in ""Jesus"" into the search bar, there was not one result.  I typed in ""God.""  Nothing.  If you can't have one book about Jesus, I can't buy from you and I will be sure to let all my friends know.  Interestingly there are results for search words like ""gay"" and ""transgender.""",,
Very Disappointed,I was searching for the book order that I made for my son early in the year (2020 - 2021) . I have never received this order or an explanation as to why not. I will make no future purchases. When I searched for my order after logging in. it said I had no orders. What the heck happened!,,
Very Disappointed,"If you are going to advertise a promotion like READS, you should take it down if it's no longer available, which is the message that appears in my cart when I am ordering well over the required amount.   You're being very misleading in your advertising.   But for supporting our teacher through the promotion you are giving to teachers whose parents place orders before September 30th, this experience makes me not want to shop from Scholastic again.",,
Very Disappointed,It said general error.,,
Very Disappointed,It was difficult to find the site.  I was redirected several times to other scholastic sites.  Your book selections are very political.  I just want to get my kid a story book.,,
Very Disappointed,It will not let me order books. Nothing shows in my cart,,
Very Disappointed,"My child is added to my teacher/school within ""My Account, My Children"" in our profile. However, no option comes up for me to ""add his name"" to each book at checkout. No matter what I try to add to my cart, when I go to the cart it's always empty w/an alert in red to assign my child to each book. Very frustrating! I've tried removing my child & adding him back to his teacher/school & that didn't work. I'm not going to create a new account because I've ordered with no issue last year. I don't want to assign a new e-mail address just to order. I've tried both on my iphone and on two computers and nothing works.",,
Very Disappointed,My shipping and payment page does not display the payment method or information necessary to make a payment.   I spoke with a represenative last year and was under the impression that the page would be fixed.,,
Very Disappointed,Navigating the mobile site is difficult,,
Very Disappointed,"Options to pay previous account balances online, not via telephone for ALL. Offer National Geographic novels in higher levels.",,
Very Disappointed,"Page isn't formatted to view on Android mobile. The page is too big for mobile viewing. Can't see all the books when scrolling, it ""skips"" over half of them.",,
Very Disappointed,"PS, not buying any books on here until you provide more unifying, less divisive subject matter.",,
Very Disappointed,Rested an account one for each child then could not get to a place to order for youngest. I was stuck at the oldest.   Will go out and try again,,
Very Disappointed,signing up i did not get points or neither did the person who shared. Also the sign up was really buggy.,,
Very Disappointed,still can not find where the editable flier is to send home,,
Very Disappointed,Stop sending me emails and stop producing sooooo many flyers that I simply recycle. Stop!!!!!,,
Very Disappointed,"The code says expired. I did what the person in chat said to do and it still doesn't work. I don't think I will be ordering, at least online, again any time soon",,
Very Disappointed,"The flyer from the teacher, does NOT match on-line.",,
Very Disappointed,"The interface takes me in circles when I'm trying to find something. It has always been challenging to have a teacher and parent account simultaneously, they do not pair well together. Very frustrated that my account is under a parent and I have no way to change it to an educator. I just want flyers to send to my students and have no way to access it or request flyers.",,
Very Disappointed,The page is stuck on the check out screen  Very frustrating,,
Very Disappointed,The search is useless.,,
Very Disappointed,"The site is very confusing to me.  It says it's the class page but it's hard to tell if the teacher has picked out books for the class or what.  Also, there is just too much going on on the page, it's hard to know where to go, which section to look in, etc.",,
Very Disappointed,"The site loads slowly, shows books I don't click on. The digital flyer is clever but not user-friendly. At all. A different format (maybe that looks less likely the flyer) would work better.",,
Very Disappointed,"The system would not allow me to place and order and ship to my home.  The children are in the middle of a nasty divorce, and I would like to have the books shipped to my home.  If the father receives the books, he will not return them.  Additionally, I order other items for Christmas and Birthdays, as well as for other grandchildren.  I would like those to be a surprise.  The system should allow me the option to ship to my home and pay for it.",,
Very Disappointed,"This has nothing to do with the website, but I am very disheartened that you charging shipping for student orders! I really don't think you should charge for teacher orders either.  I promote your books (for free I might add) and now I have a student that can not order because you are charging shipping for his books because his total is under 25.00. We all know it is getting harder and harder to get kids/parents to even order anymore and now this makes it even harder for those who do! I work in a small district and I have few kids that even order anymore, so getting to the 25.00 is hard. What if I had a student who can only afford a small amount and they were ordering all the books they could in the $1, $2, or $5 section? This is very sad to say the least and I am probably going to do away with even offering the orders and promoting them in my classroom. My student is no longer able to order the two books she wants because she can not cover the shipping charges. I am very disappointed!",,
Very Disappointed,This was such a terrible experience.  What books come in the five book bonus pack? How do you pay for the dollar books?  How does the teacher  purchase books for the classroom from the flyer?  What are thee bonus points for? If I send you the paper order how do I know who gets what? Come on scholastic- make it stress free for the teacher too!,,
Very Disappointed,This website is goddawful. I can’t figure out how to make an order and your tutorial only shows me how to send reminders and links to friends and family. I’ve been here ten minutes and I can’t figure it out. Fix your website. It sucks.,,
Very Disappointed,"Too much anti-American content or divisive material on here.  I could not find any material on pride in country, being a responsible American citizen, or Founding principles.  If Scholastic cannot expand its subject matter, I’d rather not receive this newsletter.     Do better.",,
Very Disappointed,Unable to get to the Cary to purchase.,,
Very Disappointed,was trying to find my Bonus Points #.    I  want to know IF I can transfer my balance of points to another Teacher  at a different school.  I am retiring & dont need them.,,
Very Disappointed,website is not formulated to be used with a cellphone. wouldnt even let me submit payment on my cellphone i had to use a desktop computer.,,
Very Disappointed,Website is slow to respond and download.,,
Very Disappointed,when I am at checkout and have $ to use - I should be able to pull up my wish list and add those books in.  This is very frustrating.  The system really needs to be easier for teachers.  We don't have time to navigate back and forth.,,
Very Disappointed,When I click sign in a white blank box comes up and I am unable to sign in.  I can sign in at my school but not at home. I tried connecting to my hotspot- that didn't work either. Why can I not sign in at home?,,
Very Disappointed,Why aren't the club and teacher site connected. Very lame.,,
Very Disappointed,"You don't list prices! This is insane.     Why are you trying to trick your customers, Scholastic Book Club? I am really disappointed in you. Really pathetic.",,
Very Satisfied,A book is out of stock.,,
Very Satisfied,A parent wrote a check to Scholastic while the rest of the parents sent cash.  I paid for everything on my debit card.  This means I need to contact the parent who wrote a check to you and ask them to rewrite it.,,
Very Satisfied,Adding to wish lists so that when I can get class codes (teachers haven't been updated for this year).,,
Very Satisfied,Always user-friendly. I did not place an order today but will very soon!,,
Very Satisfied,"Biggest challenge was figuring out which books were in a boxed series. I was shopping for the Magic Tree House series and needed a specific ""next"" box set. I couldn't easily distinguish which set was the correct one for me to select. The numbers were not listed in the title of the product.",,
Very Satisfied,Came to check on student order that was shipped- wrong set of books was sent.  I will be contacting customer service again as this is the 2nd time it happened this year.,,
Very Satisfied,"Christon was very helpful. I didn't get to tell them because  I clicked something and the chat disappeared from screen, though  I heard a couple extra messages.",,
Very Satisfied,Codes did not match my pamphlet,,
Very Satisfied,Could not find books that I was looking for.      Had problems last year with delivery of books.  Hope it goes better this year.,,
Very Satisfied,couldn't find certain books,,
Very Satisfied,Do you still offer free shipping to home?,,
Very Satisfied,Easy to do!,,
Very Satisfied,Easy to order!,,
Very Satisfied,Easy to put in book order,,
Very Satisfied,Everything was fine.  Looked at some products.,,
Very Satisfied,Excellent!  Much easier to use than the old format of the site.,,
Very Satisfied,First time on the site and I love it. Will come back to the site with my wife and child to pick out a few books. Thank you.,,
Very Satisfied,Flyers take a long time to load,,
Very Satisfied,For holidays I like to purchase my students a book such as Spookley the Square Pumpkin or Twas the Night Before Christmas.  The last few years many of these popular books are only offered in book bundles instead of individually.  Could you please also offer books individually so that we may purchase these classics for our entire class.,,
Very Satisfied,Glad to see the shipping issues of the past seem to be fixed.  I will place my next order soon!,,
Very Satisfied,had a difficult time looking for the class wishlist.,,
Very Satisfied,"hi just got the flyers i requested but I guess I didn't ask for the Lucky flyers or any that would be good for second graders.    In the future could you please send me any flyers See Saw, Lucky, you can be a reader, that  second graders would order from...  Thanks   Sarah Cox  2nd grade teacher  Holland Hall School  5666 E. 81   Tulsa, Ok 74137",,
Very Satisfied,Hoping the delayed shipping issues of last year are no longer around! Kids always excited for books to arrive and the 6 weeks of last year was a bit long to wait!,,
Very Satisfied,I absolutely love this company. I know that last year you had difficulties that were outside your reach. But this year I've already placed one order and received it in record time. Keep up the great job.,,
Very Satisfied,I am eager to get back to book orders after supply chain delays.,,
Very Satisfied,"I am hoping that orders will be delivered in a more timely fashion this year.  Last year, orders would take up to three weeks to process and parents were getting upset.  I am hoping there will be a faster turn around time this year.",,
Very Satisfied,I am hoping that shipping is a lot more timely this year.  I quit ordering last year(after 35 years of book ordering) because of the shipping time.  (I was embarassed in front of my class),,
Very Satisfied,I am not sure how to email parents directly from scholastic,,
Very Satisfied,I am not sure that I fixed my problem.  I have not been receiving flyers this year.  I tried to update my class info again in hopes they will start coming!,,
Very Satisfied,"I appreciate the opportunity to offer my students a variety of books to purchase.  I would like to see ""small group"" sets of books for my new grade level to purchase.",,
Very Satisfied,"I completed the survery before I was able to put in my order for it popped up as I was about to do the order/bonus part of the website. The survey should come up at the end, not at the start.",,
Very Satisfied,I couldn't complete my order because one of the student order was out of stock and I had to contact the parent to see if they wanted to change their order or get reimbursed. I used the chat feature for the first time.  I really like that feature.,,
Very Satisfied,I couldn't find one of the books that was on my granddaughter's flyer.,,
Very Satisfied,I couldn't find teacher's name. I will wait to get her class code to submit my order as I noted that purchases help teachers get free books for the classrooms. Thanks,,
Very Satisfied,"I couldnt pay with my international card, or my international paypal",,
Very Satisfied,"I couldn't remember my password but if I had known the ""requirements"" I would've been able to remember it.  Maybe it would be helpful to know how many characters the passwords are?",,
Very Satisfied,I didn’t get the promo code to work,,
Very Satisfied,"I do not see my Bonus Points for Teacher Referrals:  Briana Snyder  Alex Castellanos  Also, how do get the 300 bonus points for ordering before September 30th.  Please advise.",,
Very Satisfied,I don't like the online necessity of paying sales tax on book purchases.,,
Very Satisfied,I entered the code for a free book but it didn't take anything off of the amount of my order.,,
Very Satisfied,"I find the site hard to navigate.  The collections can sometimes be helpful, but it would be nice to be able to just look through all titles at once.",,
Very Satisfied,I found a book to add to the wish list. I will likely order it when I make my next book order.,,
Very Satisfied,"I found some good books to order today, but I'm surprised by how the flyer is shrinking.  I'm not sure if it's smaller to include more books on a page, or if the selection is shrinking.  I hope that you continue to include quality books and a good selection each month.  I'd be really disappointed if your selection diminished.",,
Very Satisfied,"I had to link my kiddo's new teacher and it was super easy! Thanks, Scholastic!",,
Very Satisfied,I have changed grade levels. I want to continue to improve literacy with my ELL and regular education students.,,
Very Satisfied,"I haven't ordered yet, but I did add to my cart.",,
Very Satisfied,"I haven't tried to get those catalogues yet, so I'm not sure if I'll be successful.",,
Very Satisfied,I kept going to book fair vs book club. but I found my way and items,,
Very Satisfied,I like being able to type the codes from the flyer and finding the books right away!,,
Very Satisfied,I like how the site keeps track of earned rewards so I don't have to figure it out on my own with codes etc.,,
Very Satisfied,I liked being able to type the item number from the paper order form into the search box.,,
Very Satisfied,I liked the questionnaire option that helped me choose a book for my child.,,
Very Satisfied,I look forward to coming back as a classroom teacher. :),,
Very Satisfied,I love scholastic book club. It has been a slow start after the pandemic but I am hoping this year will blossom with readers!    I loved your videos they were so helpful in doing the things I needed to get done!,,
Very Satisfied,"I love scholastic, but I hope there are no delays like there were last year!",,
Very Satisfied,"i love scholastic, the joy of getting my books in class sparked my love of reading and im happy to pass that love on to my child!",,
Very Satisfied,"I often struggle with on-line sites and orders.  This by far was one of the easiest transactions I have encountered,  Kudos to all involved.",,
Very Satisfied,I placed an order for my class yesterday 9/16/2022 by phone. I did not have any online orders. However a student placed an on line order this morning so I placed this order today. It was very easy to place this on line order.,,
Very Satisfied,"I plan to submit an order today, but I'm not done shopping",,
Very Satisfied,I see there is now a minimum $25 in order to receive the free shipping. There are times I have had only a couple parents order and my total amount is under this. I as a teacher would NOT want to incur the $6.50 S&H fee.,,
Very Satisfied,I want to get back to Scholastic Book Clubs to help my students build their reading skills. I look forward to recving  the order forms.,,
Very Satisfied,"I was able to find what I needed. The item numbers were very helpful with that. It was nice to get a free book with code--READS.     I think I get too many emails from the scholastic book club. In all honestly, it's the fliers that I look at before getting books. Not that I'd never want emails, but I just get too many emails, so I reach a point where I just start unsubscribing from groups.",,
Very Satisfied,I was just adding a student order today and doing a little classroom shopping.,,
Very Satisfied,"I was trying to use the READS code for the free book for several weeks and it kept saying ""expired"" but it wasn't... Finally got it to work! Thanks for the free book.",,
Very Satisfied,"I was very happy to have immediate help from ""Ronda"" on the live chat. She was able to find the information I needed in a timely manner and was quite courteous.    I was a little surprised to find that I could not look up the amount in my child's E-wallet without the help of Ronda, I have the tendency to think I've done something, but in fact just thought about doing it and I needed to make absolute sure that my daughter wouldn't be showing up on book fair day, unable to purchase anything with her class.      Other than the ability to check the amount in your child's E-wallet easily, everything else ran smoothly.",,
Very Satisfied,"I went in today to modify my profile for my new school & role. I wish there was a way that I could indicate that I am not a classroom teacher, I am a support specialist. I still order books to use with students, but I don't need you to send me class flyers.  Is there a way for me to do this?",,
Very Satisfied,I will be placing an order tomorrow and I wanted to look at any changes to the site.,,
Very Satisfied,I will be submitting an order next week. I had a parent ask for me to hold off until the weekend.,,
Very Satisfied,I will confirm with my daughter which books my granddaughter would like this time and then come back.,,
Very Satisfied,I will most likely submit an order this month. The only reason I didn't do it today is because I am waiting for my class due date before I submit.,,
Very Satisfied,I will place my personal order when students have placed their orders.,,
Very Satisfied,"if possible filters allowing me too look at subjects per age.  For example... fears/anxiety & age  options with 'where is my monster'.  Also maybe select value packs as alternate purchases when you select a particular book.   I found the above example after searching examples, then put it directly in to see if you had the book as an option.  After I completed my order I discovered there was a value pack with another similar book.",,
Very Satisfied,I'm just pre shopping of our next book order for Christmas gift ideas.,,
Very Satisfied,I'm just waiting for my kids to add books to the cart before I submit my order.,,
Very Satisfied,I'm so glad you're still in business!  I am thrilled that at least one student placed an order.  Sure wish it were more!,,
Very Satisfied,Is there a better way to search for all non-book items that are available to purchase? My middle schooler likes the posters and other items that are usually available during the book fairs. I was unable to locate any of those items during my search.,,
Very Satisfied,It sent me straight to the survey before I could order. I will do so now.,,
Very Satisfied,"It's always pretty easy to use.  If you ever make changes I'd suggest they only be slight. It's easy to search, easy to add by code, easy checkout, etc. Totally overhauling the site without keeping that simplicity in place would be a nightmare.",,
Very Satisfied,It's nice to be able to reward teachers and provide valuable reading assets to my children.,,
Very Satisfied,Just checking on student orders submitted online.  I will submit them on Friday.,,
Very Satisfied,Just checking up on my class order which is due later this week.,,
Very Satisfied,"Just wondering if parents could be prompted to select a free book when their order is over $25.  I have a family that earned a free book, but didn't make a selection.  It would be nice if they could be prompted for these rewards just like teacher's have on their checkout page.",,
Very Satisfied,"Kindly watch the woke content.  You have a duty to provide wholesome, unbiased literature to our children.  It's a powerful position to be in, please respect it.",,
Very Satisfied,Looking forward to ordering book for this school year.,,
Very Satisfied,"Love all the opportunites to earn extra points and books!  I like when you send birthday or bonus in the summer. I don't like having to remember to save the email or write them down, but I try!    I've been working on encouraging familes to support books/reading. The economy limits, but glad at least some can. I use my library to supplement.  Many teachers at my school already use Scholastic book orders or not interested, to I can't really recommend anymore.",,
Very Satisfied,Love Scholastic Book Club since I was a child. As a teacher I am trying to show how wonderful books are and where they can buy them.,,
Very Satisfied,Love scholastic!! Kids need to hold books.,,
Very Satisfied,Much easier to order online than it is to submit orders the old fashioned way like I used to have to do when I was in school!,,
Very Satisfied,Much easier to use this year.,,
Very Satisfied,"My class and I love Scholastic Book Clubs! I know shipping was a nightmare during covid but I ordered many books last year for my class and parents and I both had an easy time doing so. The books eventually got to us :) I hope this year is a bit quicker with shipping. I really encourage my parents to utilize these cheap prices. I call it BOOK DAY when our orders come in and I get books for everyone so no one feels left out. Each month it is a BIG deal to get our scholastic book orders in! Thank you!    Nicole Jones  First Grade Teacher  Hampton, NJ  UTES",,
Very Satisfied,MY CODE WOULDNT WORK SO I CALLED IN AND THEY WERE ABLE TO FIX IT!,,
Very Satisfied,"My confirmation page after my order was complete gave me an error message saying that it took too long to load and needed me to resubmit it, but when I refreshed the page, my order confirmation was there anyway.",,
Very Satisfied,"My customer # has changed, and the number of spaces for my customer # is different than what is on the envelope.",,
Very Satisfied,My customer number is not the same number I've used for the last 35 years??????,,
Very Satisfied,"My only problem is the shipping fee with paper orders under $25.  I teach at a school with lower income families and very few are able to buy books, and when a couple do, then I'm left to pay the shipping which is not fully fair.",,
Very Satisfied,N/A,,
Very Satisfied,Na,,
Very Satisfied,Nice to see everything is running smooth,,
Very Satisfied,not buying today but usually do just compiling a list so hopefully family can buy books.  love your site- thank you!,,
Very Satisfied,not complete with my order. Did find letters for parents. Love them,,
Very Satisfied,"On the mobile app, I was trying to add the ""READS"" free book, but the ""confirm and apply"" button was below the screen and I couldn't scroll far enough to be able to click it. On the computer it worked fine.",,
Very Satisfied,Opened site and prepared for my children to choose their options. Very likely to come back. I remember being SO excited for Book Fairs and Book Clubs as a kid in school. It was definitely a highlight of elementary and even middle school!,,
Very Satisfied,Ordered 2 Lego Ninjago Activity book.  Mrs Gugg9sbergm sent only one home.  Sending note to teacher tomorrow.  Thanks,,
Very Satisfied,Pretty slick being able to add in the item number from the book order to add to my cart! Did not have to search very far for the items I wanted to purchase!,,
Very Satisfied,Prices are too high. Not willing to pay $6-8 for a paperback book.,,
Very Satisfied,Quick and easy ordering.  I like that you can add items by order number.  Reviews of items help to make purchase decisions easier.,,
Very Satisfied,Really appreciate the service you offer children.,,
Very Satisfied,Shipping is wonderful this new school year in the Fall.  Seems like the bugs are worked out.,,
Very Satisfied,"Site is easy to navigate. However, I did not see the bonus catalog section. I will look when I submit order on Wednesday.  Thanks for the $1.00 book section. helps me with birthday books and holiday books.",,
Very Satisfied,"Site worked great! The search function under the site search was a little confusing since it only had the ""add to cart"" button there instead of going to the item to view the descrip. I get the idea of it, just wasn't prepared for it. This is so much easier than filling out those awful newsprint, tiny order forms lol",,
Very Satisfied,So easy that I didn't even need to watch the tutorial. Thank you!,,
Very Satisfied,Some of the digital flyers would not load to view.,,
Very Satisfied,"Some of the item #'s on the catalog page didn't match the online #'s. No big deal though, I searched by name and got them quickly.",,
Very Satisfied,"Some trouble logging in - didn't accept password, but overall easier than usual.  As I've said before your site doesn't do well with Mozilla and other browsers that focus on privacy which is annoying as I have to use chrome or edge - whichever will work that day.  Also, my biggest pain is trying to enter the due dates.  Often the Drop-down calendar will not register my date.  It would be preferable to have an option to type in a date.  Thank you - hoping things are running more smoothly this year.",,
Very Satisfied,Still plan to submit an order but wanted to verify the books in my cart my child.,,
Very Satisfied,The digital flyer wouldn't always come up,,
Very Satisfied,The READS coupon didn’t work :(,,
Very Satisfied,The site has been great. I'm just waiting on some more info and then I will place my order.,,
Very Satisfied,"The updates you are constantly making to the website are amazing and much appreciated. Each time I order, it is so much better. Thank you!",,
Very Satisfied,This site seems to work very well. I DO wish that when I chose my free $5.00 book that I would have been given the option to choose the book OR make an additional donation to the donation area. Spread even more of the love!,,
Very Satisfied,This visit to the site was to get a game plan for which books I will be purchasing within a day or so...I just didn't purchase any at this moment.,,
Very Satisfied,"This was the fastest, EASIEST book order I have ever completed.  I usually have to call you to have somebody WALK ME through the process, but this time--------it was a CHARM!!  Sooooo-keep up the good work!!  (Of having an order form that flows logically!!)",,
Very Satisfied,"Took a long time to load, just closed the page and re-opened it about an hour later and all is good.",,
Very Satisfied,Trying to make a payment,,
Very Satisfied,"Using the site is simple, which I can appreciate!",,
Very Satisfied,very well placed categories ans recommendations. Only feedback is that when I was on a recommendation page I liked 2 books and I clicked on 1 to add to cart but after that I couldnot go back to the same recommendation page and missed the second book I had liked. I then had to search for it again.,,
Very Satisfied,Waiting for teachers book list and will be buying. And getting some for my friends’ kids. I’m so excited.,,
Very Satisfied,"Was a little overwhelming to sort through the flyers and try to present options to my kindergartner, but got it done!",,
Very Satisfied,Was trying to find the $1 books to give out as gifts for my students and my daughter's class.,,
Very Satisfied,We like searching by flyer and by other lists. Thanks!,,
Very Satisfied,"When I tried to download my Family Letter, it would not open to the letter. The site stated it was not found.",,
Very Satisfied,will enter order soon - just waiting to see if my mom wants to order anything too,,
Very Satisfied,"Wish entire book orders could arrive at the same time. I get partial orders for some kids, and it’s hard to send fulfilled orders home with just some kids, and partial orders with others. I try to keep partial orders until I have all their books, but have to refer to the order history online to see if their order is complete or if there are more coming.  Takes a bit more time to,cross check the orders.",,
Very Satisfied,Wish it would let me order for my 8th grader and just send them home or to the school.,,
Very Satisfied,"Wish SBC would reinstate delivery to home, again.  It would make this book fairy's life easier, but I can work it out with the teachers.",,
Very Satisfied,Wish there was a way to edit a letter to attach to the student flyers.      Such as fonts and size.  I can't figure that out.,,
Very Satisfied,would like to see individual book options if they are also in a pack: otherwise we end up with duplicates. thanks!,,
Very Satisfied,Would not let me enter free book selection on a $176.00 order.,,
