When you pull up the flyer view, it won't let you go to the next page if you zoom in to look at anything.

Not sure if that's a user issue but I wish there was a visible tab to get back to that after making selections and checking my cart to see what my total was at. my intention was to spend 25 and then spend the $5 on a book for the teacher and I could figure out where her requests were.",Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation

Very Disappointed,When I click sign in a white blank box comes up and I am unable to sign in.  I can sign in at my school but not at home. I tried connecting to my hotspot- that didn't work either. Why can I not sign in at home?,Website,Logged Out/Repeat Log Ins/Password Help
Satisfied,The only difficulty is shopping or making Teacher Selections by level. I wish there was a way to search books by reading level.,Website,Filter/Search Options
Satisfied,I thought this was pretty straight forward. My only thing was that it took me a moment to find the button to see all books in the age group I selected rather than just a sample of what was available. Once I saw that link everything else was easy.,Website,Filter/Search Options
Very Satisfied,"When I tried to download my Family Letter, it would not open to the letter. The site stated it was not found.",Website,Parent Letter
Satisfied,If it is possible to look at books by theme a little easier it would be nice.,Website,Filter/Search Options
Satisfied,not enough books displayed on a page when looking at fiction books.  Too many pages to click through.,Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Satisfied,"There was a $1 books offer that opened to me, but when I switched pages I couldn't find it again. I was going to go back and get some but couldn't access it easily. Otherwise no problems.",Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Neutral,"the suggestions of books are very small, and it should have an option to search books by themes.",Website,Filter/Search Options
Satisfied,"I'm still learning how to navigate to what I need. Sometimes, it's not as intuitive as I'd like. Overall, I've had a positive experience with the site.",Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Disappointed,Please allow for author searching and linking. Subjects as well. Sort filter features by price and reading level while I'm dreaming.,Website,Filter/Search Options
Disappointed,It is just not user friendly. Lots of scrolling. and the information you're looking for is not really in the place you are looking for it to be in.,Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Neutral,"When on mobile, hard to find how to order for book club to benefit classroom.",Website,Mobile Compatibility
Satisfied,Sign in period is too short.  Most times when browsing I need to come back and find I've been signed out.  It's just annoying to sign back in is all.,Website,Logged Out/Repeat Log Ins/Password Help
Neutral,"I don't think it's the most user friendly site. Also, I don't appreciate how Scholastic has raised the price so much that most of our families can't afford to get the books anymore.",Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation

Satisfied,"The search functions are a little antiquated, but I was able to complete, thanks!",Website,Filter/Search Options
Satisfied,"i wasn't able to find a way to search by topic, like self regulation.  I just had to hope it came up.  You should have a tab for kids on spectrum.  Maybe you do but it wasn't obvious.",Website,Filter/Search Options
Very Satisfied,"Some trouble logging in - didn't accept password, but overall easier than usual.  As I've said before your site doesn't do well with Mozilla and other browsers that focus on privacy which is annoying as I have to use chrome or edge - whichever will work that day.  Also, my biggest pain is trying to enter the due dates.  Often the Drop-down calendar will not register my date.  It would be preferable to have an option to type in a date.  Thank you - hoping things are running more smoothly this year.",Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Very Disappointed,It will not let me order books. Nothing shows in my cart,Website,Shopping Cart/Checkout
Very Satisfied,"if possible filters allowing me too look at subjects per age.  For example... fears/anxiety & age  options with 'where is my monster'.  Also maybe select value packs as alternate purchases when you select a particular book.   I found the above example after searching examples, then put it directly in to see if you had the book as an option.  After I completed my order I discovered there was a value pack with another similar book.",Website,Filter/Search Options

Very Disappointed,website is not formulated to be used with a cellphone. wouldnt even let me submit payment on my cellphone i had to use a desktop computer.,Website,Mobile Compatibility
Neutral,"I put items in my cart, but the site would not let me log in so I could buy the books I wanted to purchase. I had an account last year and my grandson s now in first grade, so i need to chanfge classrooms, which i did, but then I could not log in. I tried to create a new account, but could not do that either. I am not impressed with your website a the moment.",Website,Shopping Cart/Checkout

Satisfied,I tried to pull up the2nd & 4th grade flyers to view. they never came up even after I clicked the help if  having trouble,Website,Digital Flyer
Very Satisfied,The digital flyer wouldn't always come up,Website,Digital Flyer

Satisfied,It was hard to get to the flyers but overall it was a good visit!,Website,Digital Flyer
Satisfied,"Not difficulties per se, but the website doesn't always feel intuitive for figuring out how to do what I need as a teacher. This is only my second year, so maybe that's why.",Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation

Very Disappointed,Unable to get to the Cary to purchase.,Website,Shopping Cart/Checkout

Satisfied,I had a hard time trying to change my password.,Website,Logged Out/Repeat Log Ins/Password Help
Disappointed,"I am unable to find books via searching. I searched for the title  ""Marcus Makes a Movie"" and the author ""Kevin Hart,"" among others and the books in your flyer did not come up. I used to work in a library so I know how to search books. I was able to use the item number, but it's absurd that using the titles of the book does not work. I am very disappointed with how poor your site operates.",Website,Filter/Search Options
Satisfied,Sometimes the digital flyers would not load and I would have to keep refreshing the page. Other than that I am a big Scholastic fan and love ordering books!,Website,Digital Flyer
Neutral,difficult to figure out where to make changes to account.  Site not clear.,Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Satisfied,"I like being able to see tons and tons of books, but I wish there was an option to search based on price and not by grade or age. I really like the selection of suggested books at the bottom of the page after you click on a book. I feel like there are so many books I am missing and struggle to be able to search appropriately on my phone.",Website,Filter/Search Options

Very Disappointed,This website is goddawful. I can’t figure out how to make an order and your tutorial only shows me how to send reminders and links to friends and family. I’ve been here ten minutes and I can’t figure it out. Fix your website. It sucks.,Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation
