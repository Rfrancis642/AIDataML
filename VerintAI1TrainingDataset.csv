Neutral,"We enjoy ordering books from Scholastic but the wording of this survey has me wondering if anyone actually read through this before publishing it. The three Yes/No questions explain that you should answer Yes if your answer is No and No if your answer is Yes.

Very Satisfied,"Site worked great! The search function under the site search was a little confusing since it only had the ""add to cart"" button there instead of going to the item to view the descrip.

Neutral,"I find the site has not been updated in 3 years, since I was last in the classroom. It is not the most user-friendly to maneuver in between the teacher wish list and book selecting.

I was not impressed with the site. I would recommend the books, but I would also warn everyone about using the site.",Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation

Neutral,"I am truly not trying to sound negative or that I'm complaining, but your website is incredibly difficult to navigate. There are WAY to many things to look on every page that I go to. Perhaps student orders can show up as JUST their names with a drop down option if you want to see what they've ordered? I don't know... it's just really challenging every time I come to this site.

It was also difficult to see the text when I was viewing sample pages.  Sometimes I was able to get it to zoom in on the words by moving my mouse over and sometimes it would not.   It was also frustrating to have to keep clicking on the see full details button to read a description of the story.,Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation

However, when entering names, I thought I could download the list but I saw that all those names came up as one student. Then, I could not delete my error so I had to continue and add students  one at a time. This involved typing name, clicking add, having to click in box again to type another name., etc. Then time expired and I do not know what students I have listed.   I did not continue because it would take more time.    I did share the SBC to 2 of our new colleagues. I hope they do not get discouraged.",Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation

Neutral,"When my account pulls up, it pulls up to my parent account.  I want it to pull up to my teacher account.  I guess I will have to cancel the parent account because otherwise I have to try to figure out how to see student orders- it's not very user friendly.    When you pull up the flyer view, it won't let you go to the next page if you zoom in to look at anything.  You should still be able to click the arrow to turn the page even if you zoom in to see a book description instead of going all the way out and starting over.",Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation

Disappointed,"Historically, I find the Scholastic Book Club site very challenging to navigate",Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Very Disappointed,"The site loads slowly, shows books I don't click on. The digital flyer is clever but not user-friendly. At all. A different format (maybe that looks less likely the flyer) would work better.",Website,Digital Flyer
Very Disappointed,"The interface takes me in circles when I'm trying to find something. It has always been challenging to have a teacher and parent account simultaneously, they do not pair well together. Very frustrated that my account is under a parent and I have no way to change it to an educator. I just want flyers to send to my students and have no way to access it or request flyers.",Website,Userability/Performance/Navigation

Disappointed,"I can't find two students who placed an order.  My cart is empty, but it says I have two students who ordered.  I really hope this isn't a repeat of last year when I waited from Sept. to the end of Nov. for my first book order....",Website,Shopping Cart/Checkout
Satisfied,It would be nice to shop by flyer without having to download every flyer,Website,Digital Flyer
Satisfied,"The website (and this could be operator error) would get stuck as I was trying to place the orders.  It would not let me scroll down the list of the catelog to check certain books.  I had to refresh and then it let me scroll down.  Otherwise, I like the option of being able to look at the flyer and having items shipped to my home so that they are not lost at the school. or if we need to go virtual with the pandemic.  Thank you for making these changes.  I have always loved Scholastic book club.",Website,Shopping Cart/Checkout
Very Satisfied,"Was a little overwhelming to sort through the flyers and try to present options to my kindergartner, but got it done!",Website,Digital Flyer
Very Disappointed,Congratulations- my new password for this site contains the words This is stupid.  I have been a parent ordering books for almost 10 years and the absolutely ridiculous crap I had to go through to log back in after forgetting my password was exceedingly frustrating.  What a waste of my time.  Next time I will go to the bookstore or library to get my kids’ books.  The drive will take less time.  I couldn’t even complete my order before this stupid survey popped up.,Website,Survey Pop Up

Very Disappointed,"This has nothing to do with the website, but I am very disheartened that you charging shipping for student orders! I really don't think you should charge for teacher orders either.  I promote your books (for free I might add) and now I have a student that can not order because you are charging shipping for his books because his total is under 25.00. We all know it is getting harder and harder to get kids/parents to even order anymore and now this makes it even harder for those who do! I work in a small district and I have few kids that even order anymore, so getting to the 25.00 is hard. What if I had a student who can only afford a small amount and they were ordering all the books they could in the $1, $2, or $5 section? This is very sad to say the least and I am probably going to do away with even offering the orders and promoting them in my classroom. My student is no longer able to order the two books she wants because she can not cover the shipping charges. I am very disappointed!",All Other,Shipping Fee

Disappointed,"Why are you selling books that normalize harsh parenting methods that humiliate and shame children?  While browsing, I saw a book called ""David Gets in Trouble"" that showed a child on the cover sitting in a corner.  The 1950s called and they would like their degrading treatment of children back.  Additionally, I saw you are selling the ""How Do Dinosaurs..."" series which also normalizes emotionally aggressive relationships between parents and children.  Families have problems, yes.  Please do not normalize parental mistreatment of children and CONDITIONAL (rather than unconditional) love.  Please sell books that depict healthy methods of parents guiding their children morally and ethically.  Children being mistreated by their parents don't always realize that what their parents are doing is not healthy.  Normalizing harsh parenting through literature does not help.  It can take years for children to realize that their parents mistreated them and they should not repeat the same patterns",All Other,Products Offered
