Very Satisfied,"Site worked great! The search function under the site search was a little confusing since it only had the ""add to cart"" button there instead of going to the item to view the descrip. I get the idea of it, just wasn't prepared for it. This is so much easier than filling out those awful newsprint, tiny order forms lol",TRUE,Filter/Search Options

Neutral,"I find the site has not been updated in 3 years, since I was last in the classroom. It is not the most user-friendly to maneuver in between the teacher wish list and book selecting.

Very Satisfied,very well placed categories ans recommendations. Only feedback is that when I was on a recommendation page I liked 2 books and I clicked on 1 to add to cart but after that I couldnot go back to the same recommendation page and missed the second book I had liked.

Very Disappointed,It said general error.,TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Neutral,"I am truly not trying to sound negative or that I'm complaining, but your website is incredibly difficult to navigate. There are WAY to many things to look on every page that I go to. Perhaps student orders can show up as JUST their names with a drop down option if you want to see what they've ordered? I don't know... it's just really challenging every time I come to this site.

Disappointed,"Very slow, site freezing.",TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Satisfied,I was unable to find the book packs listed on the cover pages of the flyers sent to me.  I wasn't sure where to find them.   It was also difficult to see the text when I was viewing sample pages.  Sometimes I was able to get it to zoom in on the words by moving my mouse over and sometimes it would not.   It was also frustrating to have to keep clicking on the see full details button to read a description of the story.,TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation

Neutral,"I am unsure if I sent the email to parents. I was in the middle of adding students and I was told that my time expired. However, when entering names, I thought I could download the list but I saw that all those names came up as one student. Then, I could not delete my error so I had to continue and add students  one at a time. This involved typing name, clicking add, having to click in box again to type another name., etc. Then time expired and I do not know what students I have listed.   I did not continue because it would take more time.    I did share the SBC to 2 of our new colleagues. I hope they do not get discouraged.",TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation
Neutral,Very slow to load,TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation

Neutral,"When my account pulls up, it pulls up to my parent account.  I want it to pull up to my teacher account.  I guess I will have to cancel the parent account because otherwise I have to try to figure out how to see student orders- it's not very user friendly.    When you pull up the flyer view, it won't let you go to the next page if you zoom in to look at anything.

Very Disappointed,"The interface takes me in circles when I'm trying to find something. It has always been challenging to have a teacher and parent account simultaneously, they do not pair well together.

Satisfied,It would be nice to shop by flyer without having to download every flyer,TRUE,Digital Flyer
Satisfied,"The website (and this could be operator error) would get stuck as I was trying to place the orders.  It would not let me scroll down the list of the catelog to check certain books.  I had to refresh and then it let me scroll down.  Otherwise, I like the option of being able to look at the flyer and having items shipped to my home so that they are not lost at the school. or if we need to go virtual with the pandemic.

Very Disappointed,Congratulations- my new password for this site contains the words This is stupid.  I have been a parent ordering books for almost 10 years and the absolutely ridiculous crap I had to go through to log back in after forgetting my password was exceedingly frustrating.

I couldn’t even complete my order before this stupid survey popped up.,TRUE,Survey Pop Up
Satisfied,"Still getting used to using the online, but I was not able to get back to the teachers list after I chose some books. Not sure if that's a user issue but I wish there was a visible tab to get back to that after making selections and checking my cart to see what my total was at. my intention was to spend 25 and then spend the $5 on a book for the teacher and I could figure out where her requests were.",TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation

Disappointed,"First, what the heck is the difference between a book fair and a book store? Why does it still look like I'm benefiting my niece's old school from past years, when I tried to sign up with my daughter's new school? Your flyers stopped loading for me after I'd looked at several. The cart doesn't have an easily visible total... I have to scroll all the way to the bottom, which feels like extra work when I just want to know where things stand before I add more books (or subtract some).",TRUE,Userability/Performance/Navigation
