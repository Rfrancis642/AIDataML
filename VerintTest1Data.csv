Disappointed,"This was my second order and I thought, based on total dollars spent and the information presented, that the order qualified for $10 free books and a free group of books. I continued to choose the $10 in free books only to be charged the $10. After going back to the beginning several times, I realized I should read the small print that said the freebies were only once between August and September. If a teacher already utilized this freebie, it should not pop up and give an alert about this reward. Little hurdles like this when ordering seem to frustrate teachers. Make order user friendly please.",,
Neutral,"Website is glitchy and slow. It froze up. Also the pop-up  windows in the middle of the page are cut off on the screen and do not allow you to scroll down, (for example this survey) I had to tab down. This website needs a lot of work.",,

Neutral,I think that it should be noted that teachers should wait to enter in all their students orders at once otherwise we loose bonus points.,,
Satisfied,Flyer wouldn't load and clicking link still didn't work,,
Very Disappointed,"The site is very confusing to me.  It says it's the class page but it's hard to tell if the teacher has picked out books for the class or what.  Also, there is just too much going on on the page, it's hard to know where to go, which section to look in, etc.",,
Disappointed,Took forever to find the spot to enter my child's classroom code. Almost gave up and didn't order anything.,,
Neutral,I did not see my ewallet for the fair tomorrow,,

Very Satisfied,"I found some good books to order today, but I'm surprised by how the flyer is shrinking.  I'm not sure if it's smaller to include more books on a page, or if the selection is shrinking.  I hope that you continue to include quality books and a good selection each month.  I'd be really disappointed if your selection diminished.",,
Satisfied,Everything worked well.,,
Satisfied,"Not many parents are ordering books anymore.  I used to have huge book orders in the past.  Since my class didn't order 25 dollars worth, I missed out on the great coupon offers.  I don't want to add my own money to orders in order to get 10 dollars free.  Possibly add a 5 dollars free to the classroom that is under the 25 dollar mark.",,

Very Satisfied,Easy to navigate and search for what I was looking for,,
Satisfied,"I had to re-load the page and log in 3 times before the teacher information became available to me. It did not show that I was a teacher with orders waiting. It kept showing an empty cart. In the end, using the same log in that I had used twice before, it finally showed my teacher information and allowed me to order.   Having said that, I still LOVE Scholastic.  You have been a mainstay of my classroom for so many years - I don't know what I'd do without you. 3",,

Also, the Business Reply envelopes I'm sent with our flyer have the Scholastic Book Clubs' zip code as 45273-8504  The zip code on your website is different: 45263-0446 ... please correct.

Disappointed,"I tried to submit my order yesterday.  When I clicked ""Submit Order"", it brought me back to the shopping cart but did not tell my why.  I tried multiple times, from different devices and it still wasn't working.  I then contacted costumer support via chat and the same thing was happening to that person.  She told me she'd put in a work order but I may not hear back for 2-3 days.  I decided to try again today and it did work.  This time, it gave me an error message in my cart telling me one of my items was out of stock.  I wish this error popped up yesterday so that I didn't have to spend my entire plan time trying to problem solve without luck.  Thankfully today it did work.",,

Very Satisfied,I liked the questionnaire option that helped me choose a book for my child.,,
Very Satisfied,Easy,,
Disappointed,Very slow to load sign-in pages,,
Satisfied,"so so difficulty. It would be nice if when entering the free $5 book code, it would change the $5 book already on your order into the free book, rather than requiring you to enter the free book again and deleting the $5 book on your order.",,
Very Satisfied,I am not sure how to email parents directly from scholastic,,

Disappointed,Scholastic has not been helpful......we are stilled owed books from last school year.,,
Neutral,"I like to view the flyers because it is easier to pick out titles I might be interested in purchasing.  The site was having issues and the flyers weren't coming up to view.  It was frustrating so I gave up and will try again later.  Also, I know inflation is causing everything to go up, but it is disappointing to see the once $1 books in each grade level flyer continues to go up.  I work at a Title I school and it is nice to see books that ALL kids can afford.  I usually purchase a large number of these deal books to give away in my library each month.  Now that chapter books cost $3+ I will not be able to purchase as many to give away.  I understand Scholastic is a business, but it is a little disappointing.",,
Neutral,make it easier to post a link so friends and family can buy my child books,,

Very Satisfied,Nice to see everything is running smooth,,
Neutral,"We LOVE scholastic, that was one of my favorite parts of teaching was ordering books. i miss the $1 books but i understand the price of inflation.",,
Satisfied,"Easy to add items to wish list and cart. Sometimes navigation is difficult (e.g., once get to checkout, it would be nice to have a back button ('back to shopping'), rather than using the browser back button or having to go back 'home' and navigate back to where I was before entering checkout).",,
Satisfied,Trying to edit my order since this teacher is no longer at Pikeside Pre-K in Martinsburg WV on Winchester avenue and it won't let me.,,

Very Satisfied,"Site worked great! The search function under the site search was a little confusing since it only had the ""add to cart"" button there instead of going to the item to view the descrip.

Satisfied,a couple books I wanted were not available as individual books and were only available as a set and we have most of the set.,,

Neutral,"I find the site has not been updated in 3 years, since I was last in the classroom. It is not the most user-friendly to maneuver in between the teacher wish list and book selecting.

Very Satisfied,Thank you!!!,,
Neutral,Looking for a connection to order flyers  sent to my school.  In previous years they were automatically sent to my school.  This year they  were not. I would like flyers for Early Childhood and Firefly.,,
Very Satisfied,"It's always pretty easy to use.  If you ever make changes I'd suggest they only be slight. It's easy to search, easy to add by code, easy checkout, etc. Totally overhauling the site without keeping that simplicity in place would be a nightmare.",,

Very Satisfied,Do you still offer free shipping to home?,,
Neutral,website is user friendly and easy to use.  Found what I was looking for and made my purchase. Simple and easy.,,
Neutral,"should be able to place books in ""shopping cart"" directly from the digital flyer. The numbers on the digital flyer are too small to easily read. Should be listed when click on the book.",,
Very Disappointed,"I was going to order some books for my daughter per her preschool's request, as I have done countless times before, as this is for our 5th child.  I wanted to buy some Christian books in addition to secular ones.  When I typed in ""Jesus"" into the search bar, there was not one result.  I typed in ""God.""  Nothing.  If you can't have one book about Jesus, I can't buy from you and I will be sure to let all my friends know.  Interestingly there are results for search words like ""gay"" and ""transgender.""",,

Very Satisfied,very well placed categories ans recommendations. Only feedback is that when I was on a recommendation page I liked 2 books and I clicked on 1 to add to cart but after that I couldnot go back to the same recommendation page and missed the second book I had liked. I then had to search for it again.,,
Satisfied,The representative that assisted me was very helpful to complete my order.,,
Neutral,The survey popped up before I could complete what I was doing.,,
Satisfied,Sometimes I find it hard to locate the collection deals or the book of the week sale,,
Satisfied,I am not sure that the entire process is intuitive but I am muddling through.,,
Satisfied,It would be helpful if we could see the titles of all books that are in book bundles before placing the order. I did not order the unicorn diaries bundle today because I couldn't read what titles were included.,,
Neutral,"Thank you for my latest order, we love the books! I was told that once the order ships I would receive an e-mail and could then call to have the tax removed. That has not yet happened. I also earned $10 in free books and a multipack preschool, that were both missing from the shipment.",,

Very Satisfied,A parent wrote a check to Scholastic while the rest of the parents sent cash.  I paid for everything on my debit card.  This means I need to contact the parent who wrote a check to you and ask them to rewrite it.,,
Neutral,The process to confirm an online order placed by a parent is overly complicated & redundant.,,

Satisfied,A little difficult to apply a coupon and use it- but I figured it out.,,

Satisfied,"If connect to the teacher, should not require sign up process.",,
Neutral,All were good,,
Satisfied,It timed out and did not keep what I had done. I had to re-enter everything.,,
Neutral,"You have to know the code, or which specific teacher's name to order under and then you make an account?  Does not make any sense!  You cannot even browse through books on the flyer you were handed, that did not have a code printed on it!!!",,
Disappointed,"I struggling with ordering simply because there isn't enough variety.  I'd like to see more stable books offered instead of bandwagon books that don't last the test of time.  Also, the prices are so high parents don't even want me to bother with sending out class orders.  I always hope I'll find something for my classroom, but that is getting very hard to do anymore.",,
Very Satisfied,This visit to the site was to get a game plan for which books I will be purchasing within a day or so...I just didn't purchase any at this moment.,,
Very Disappointed,cant find teacher and no code,,

Very Satisfied,Very easy to use.,,
Satisfied,"once i find this site it's ok.  but there are like two scholastic sites that i can't differentiate and i can't find the books on one of them, but they are almost exactly alike.  i hate that.",,

Satisfied,"It would be great if teachers/parents could search by price (for example in the search bar enter ""$1"" and all the $1 books came up)",,
Satisfied,The button to SEE ALL in a section doesn't stand out easily,,
Very Satisfied,Easy to use and search for titles.,,
Very Satisfied,"Site is easy to navigate. However, I did not see the bonus catalog section. I will look when I submit order on Wednesday.  Thanks for the $1.00 book section. helps me with birthday books and holiday books.",,
Satisfied,It would be great if you had a way to sort by price or browse for books below a certain price point.,,
Very Satisfied,Reading gonna helps your child to be smarter.,,
Very Satisfied,"My only problem is the shipping fee with paper orders under $25.  I teach at a school with lower income families and very few are able to buy books, and when a couple do, then I'm left to pay the shipping which is not fully fair.",,
Very Satisfied,Na,,
Neutral,Easy and straightforward,,

Neutral,cant search for a book,,
Neutral,I love scholastic books!,,
Very Satisfied,I have enjoyed Scholastic book orders since I was a child myself.  I have been ordering for 31 years as a teacher.,,
Satisfied,Would perfer a long list (with pictures) of the books you offer. Categorizing them doesn't always make things easier. I kept seeing the same 15 books. Sure there are more.,,
Satisfied,I need to make my status inactive.  I do not need any flyers right now and need to stop them from being mailed to me at my school.,,
Disappointed,The website is very difficult to navigate to find where to add funds to my childrens account for shopping at their book fair in person.  Links from the email just direct to the log in page and don’t get to where you are trying to go.  It would be nice to have a feature that would provide a link for family members to fund their book shopping account as well.,,
Very Satisfied,Very easy to navigate. :),,
Satisfied,"I wish there was a way to search or sort by price. For example, as a parent (or a teacher) looking to build my library on a tight budget, I'd love to search for all the $5 and under books. Or knowing that Scholastic has dollar deals, all the $2 books.",,
Neutral,I love this site. It's so convenient.,,
Neutral,Just initial navigation is a little confusing,,
Satisfied,The way the free book code needed to be entered was a bit confusing. I ended up ordering two copies of the same book.,,

Satisfied,"trying to figure out how many bonus points I have  *thank you for all the great prices, bonuses, shipping :)",,
Neutral,great website. always a deal. love the website.,,
Very Disappointed,It was difficult to find the site.  I was redirected several times to other scholastic sites.  Your book selections are very political.  I just want to get my kid a story book.,,
Very Satisfied,I am hoping that shipping is a lot more timely this year.  I quit ordering last year(after 35 years of book ordering) because of the shipping time.  (I was embarassed in front of my class),,

Very Satisfied,I have used Scholastic Book Clubs when I taught before and I absolutely loved the deals and freebies!,,

Very Satisfied,Just checking on student orders submitted online.  I will submit them on Friday.,,

Very Satisfied,"Kindly watch the woke content.  You have a duty to provide wholesome, unbiased literature to our children.  It's a powerful position to be in, please respect it.",,
Disappointed,It is hard to find the electronic wallet to add additional money.,,
Satisfied,I am surprised that my customer number was changed.  It was the same number for years.  Why did it change and did everything from my old account merge or do I have 2 accounts?,,
Neutral,It's really easy to fin books in this website.,,

Very Satisfied,Adding to wish lists so that when I can get class codes (teachers haven't been updated for this year).,,

Very Disappointed,It said general error.,,
Disappointed,Very hard to find the link for parents and the school book order.,,
Neutral,"I am truly not trying to sound negative or that I'm complaining, but your website is incredibly difficult to navigate. There are WAY to many things to look on every page that I go to. Perhaps student orders can show up as JUST their names with a drop down option if you want to see what they've ordered? I don't know... it's just really challenging every time I come to this site. Like I said, I'm NOT trying to complain... I LOVE children's books and I LOVE promoting them. I just have a really hard time on your website. Thank you",,
Satisfied,Good selection of books for children - to honor themselves and others,,

Very Satisfied,Amazing,,
Very Disappointed,"PS, not buying any books on here until you provide more unifying, less divisive subject matter.",,
Very Disappointed,"Too much anti-American content or divisive material on here.  I could not find any material on pride in country, being a responsible American citizen, or Founding principles.  If Scholastic cannot expand its subject matter, I’d rather not receive this newsletter.     Do better.",,
Disappointed,"Very slow, site freezing.",,
Satisfied,I was unable to find the book packs listed on the cover pages of the flyers sent to me.  I wasn't sure where to find them.   It was also difficult to see the text when I was viewing sample pages.  Sometimes I was able to get it to zoom in on the words by moving my mouse over and sometimes it would not.   It was also frustrating to have to keep clicking on the see full details button to read a description of the story.,,
Very Satisfied,Keep up the great workd!,,
Very Satisfied,This site seems to work very well. I DO wish that when I chose my free $5.00 book that I would have been given the option to choose the book OR make an additional donation to the donation area. Spread even more of the love!,,

Very Disappointed,Rested an account one for each child then could not get to a place to order for youngest. I was stuck at the oldest.   Will go out and try again,,
Neutral,I had trouble viewing the digital flyer.,,
Satisfied,Need to make sure that I will be receiving my flyers at my site this year for each month. They did not come directly to me but came in bundles with other schools from the district in it. I often missed the flyers altogether because they never arrived at our site and I would have to call scholastic to send the flyers directly to me and that took a few days for them to arrive.,,
Very Satisfied,Site is easy to navigate.,,
Neutral,"Promo code did not work for the $25.00 order and get a free $5 book.  Also, it would have been nice to check out as a guest as I do not want to receive emails from Scholastic.",,
Very Satisfied,I liked being able to type the item number from the paper order form into the search box.,,
Neutral,"I am unsure if I sent the email to parents. I was in the middle of adding students and I was told that my time expired. However, when entering names, I thought I could download the list but I saw that all those names came up as one student. Then, I could not delete my error so I had to continue and add students  one at a time. This involved typing name, clicking add, having to click in box again to type another name., etc. Then time expired and I do not know what students I have listed.   I did not continue because it would take more time.    I did share the SBC to 2 of our new colleagues. I hope they do not get discouraged.",,
Neutral,Very slow to load,,
Very Satisfied,Very easy to order books,,
Satisfied,"The hover behavior where it opens a dialog when you're in the catalog view is a little weird, but it works.    Tried to search for ""how it's built"" books, and the search definitely seems like it could use improvement. No results for ""sailboat"" even though there's a sailboat book in there.",,
Very Satisfied,"Wish SBC would reinstate delivery to home, again.  It would make this book fairy's life easier, but I can work it out with the teachers.",,
Satisfied,"Below ,in this survey , you asked me if I need assistance ( which I don't ) , then my email was required regardless. Why?",,
Satisfied,Just deleting names from my contact list...it didn't transfer over nicely or communicate with google well.,,
Satisfied,One of my students did not get a book she ordered.,,
Neutral,"I find that I often get redirected to the teacher store, when all I want is to order books through the book orders. I saw the flyers advertising a lot of 6 books for $7.00, which is so helpful for my book clubs, and I was just trying to see what other titles were offered in that same deal. It was hard to find that.",,
Very Satisfied,Love this program!!,,
Satisfied,"The site is pretty easy to get around on.  I do like that you tell us right away if a book is out of stock.  Then we can just let the families know, and there is not this long wait time, like last year.  Thank you!",,
Satisfied,"Just that a book was ""out of stock""",,
Very Satisfied,"I completed the survery before I was able to put in my order for it popped up as I was about to do the order/bonus part of the website. The survey should come up at the end, not at the start.",,
Very Satisfied,"I plan to submit an order today, but I'm not done shopping",,

Very Disappointed,was trying to find my Bonus Points #.    I  want to know IF I can transfer my balance of points to another Teacher  at a different school.  I am retiring & dont need them.,,
Very Satisfied,Love Scholastic!,,
Satisfied,"My daughter is in a dual language program at school.  She has half the day in spanish. I wish that the Leo flier was more often. I know it used to be almost every month. Now  (unless that has changed this year)  it is only twice a year.  I think you should market your Leo flier to teachers that are DLI. Spanish books are more expensive (in my experience) and most of my child's teachers are new since the program is new to our school.  Also, I have really noticed that the prices on everything have gone up. I suppose it is due to the state of the world, but it makes me sad.",,
Very Satisfied,East experience,,
Neutral,There were so many pop ups and notifications it was hard to see where I had to go and where to enter the actual order. Please make it more user friendly. thank you,,
Very Satisfied,I love your site! So easy to use.,,
Very Disappointed,"My child is added to my teacher/school within ""My Account, My Children"" in our profile. However, no option comes up for me to ""add his name"" to each book at checkout. No matter what I try to add to my cart, when I go to the cart it's always empty w/an alert in red to assign my child to each book. Very frustrating! I've tried removing my child & adding him back to his teacher/school & that didn't work. I'm not going to create a new account because I've ordered with no issue last year. I don't want to assign a new e-mail address just to order. I've tried both on my iphone and on two computers and nothing works.",,
Neutral,Purchasing the books I wanted was easy and quick.,,
Satisfied,I wish that you could also search for books by price.  I often have money to spend (earned rewards) and sometimes difficult to spend the exact amount.  Being able to search by price would help with this process.,,
Neutral,I would love to be able to search books by reading level (vs. age level).,,
Very Satisfied,easy,,
Satisfied,it logged me out after a few minutes of inactivity but once i logged back in all my items were still in my shopping cart,,
Satisfied,sad that scholastic got rid of the 50 cents cheaper when ordering online,,
Neutral,"I have been using Scholastic for years and I am currently having a difficult time recommending books to my kindergarten families.  The prices have increased tremendously, while the selection has decreased.  I'm hoping that you will offer most books in the $3 - $4 range with a few choices in the $2 range.  You are also offering books in packs, but not offering the titles separately.  I won't buy the pack when I already have most titles.",,
Neutral,"Maybe I am just missing it, but I really wish I could find books by the skill level of the reader better. My son has dyslexia and isn't reading at his grade level, so it makes finding books for him on this site difficult.",,
Satisfied,I wanted to use bonus points to buy a book but the system charged instead of using the bonus points. I ended up deleting the book.  Hopefully I can order it with the bonus points next month.,,
Neutral,a little confusing which program is which and where to go to just order and look at books,,
Very Satisfied,"I haven't tried to get those catalogues yet, so I'm not sure if I'll be successful.",,
Very Satisfied,Very easy to use site! Love how we could shop the flyer so easily!,,
Satisfied,It's not user friendly unless you are knowledgeable with the site,,
Very Satisfied,Love the updates made to this site. Easy to navigate and you have  created a more interesting site to peruse.,,
Satisfied,Some parts wouldn't load. It would also be nice if you could add to cart straight from the brochure page,,
Very Satisfied,"I love all the books you have, and very affordable.",,
Neutral,"When my account pulls up, it pulls up to my parent account.  I want it to pull up to my teacher account.  I guess I will have to cancel the parent account because otherwise I have to try to figure out how to see student orders- it's not very user friendly.    When you pull up the flyer view, it won't let you go to the next page if you zoom in to look at anything.  You should still be able to click the arrow to turn the page even if you zoom in to see a book description instead of going all the way out and starting over.",,
Satisfied,Would like option to have a quick translated Spanish version  of the Family Letter - Could not find.  Thank you   -    The website gets improved each year - and teachers/parents really appreciate that.,,
Very Satisfied,I'm just pre shopping of our next book order for Christmas gift ideas.,,
Satisfied,I work in the school library and would like to have the links to several age group flyers available in the email that gets auto created.,,
Neutral,"Some of the features on the website are a little difficult to manage on various devices--the popups (while helpful at times) often get in the way of the task at hand.  The website was very difficult to use on an iPad, but much better on a laptop.",,
Satisfied,It's hard to find the exact books on the teacher's list.,,
Very Satisfied,First time on the site and I love it. Will come back to the site with my wife and child to pick out a few books. Thank you.,,

Neutral,you don't save .50 on books ordering online and you have to pay tax.,,
Very Satisfied,Very easy to navigate.,,
Neutral,"I would appreciate an easier way to look at the flyers...maybe in alphabetical list for with a picture of the book  beside each listing.    It would also be wonderful if there were more books available with a Christian theme, especially at Christmas and Easter.",,
Disappointed,"Historically, I find the Scholastic Book Club site very challenging to navigate",,
Neutral,I have parents who place book orders after I have submitted the order.  It is less than 12 hours after I have done so and the parents are told their child's order will be shipped in October.  He then calls and is on the phone for over 30 minutes.  Why do you make it so difficult to place orders?  My class order is still processing so why is it even an issue?    Please email me.  I had another parent place an order a day later.  Will that order be sent with my class order?,,
Very Disappointed,"The site loads slowly, shows books I don't click on. The digital flyer is clever but not user-friendly. At all. A different format (maybe that looks less likely the flyer) would work better.",,
Very Disappointed,"The interface takes me in circles when I'm trying to find something. It has always been challenging to have a teacher and parent account simultaneously, they do not pair well together. Very frustrated that my account is under a parent and I have no way to change it to an educator. I just want flyers to send to my students and have no way to access it or request flyers.",,
Satisfied,I wish you would not charge tax (just have it already added in the book price). Also I miss getting a receipt with my order.,,
Neutral,"It's frustrating to not be able to get the next book in a series. For example, the Wings of Fire. My daughter read the first one to see if she liked it but we don't want the set because we already have the first one. We just want the second book, but will have to get it somewhere else.  Thanks",,
Very Satisfied,This was the easiest and fastest website that I've ever visited and purchased from.,,
Satisfied,Didn't place the order today because the due date is next week.,,
Very Satisfied,"I love all the books you have, and very affordable.",,

Neutral,I am not able to find the scholastic code for families to use online to shop from my classroom,,
Satisfied,It’s difficult to swipe right and see all the books in a category.,,
Very Satisfied,I love Scholastic!,,
Neutral,This book club has been around since I was a child and am glad it continues on for our child today. That is over 20 years of amazing service to bringing books into our home. Thank you,,
Very Disappointed,"Every time I add a book to cart, I get a pop-up that says added to cart, but then the cart is still empty.",,
Satisfied,It just took me a while to find the dollar section that was available to me.  I hope that the books do not take as long as last year to arrive!,,
Disappointed,"I can't find two students who placed an order.  My cart is empty, but it says I have two students who ordered.  I really hope this isn't a repeat of last year when I waited from Sept. to the end of Nov. for my first book order....",,
Very Satisfied,Thank you,,
Satisfied,the books are more expensive than Amazon,,
Very Satisfied,Easy to do!,,

Very Satisfied,Easy clicks! Excellent! Rate A++++,,
Satisfied,It would be nice to shop by flyer without having to download every flyer,,
Satisfied,"The website (and this could be operator error) would get stuck as I was trying to place the orders.  It would not let me scroll down the list of the catelog to check certain books.  I had to refresh and then it let me scroll down.  Otherwise, I like the option of being able to look at the flyer and having items shipped to my home so that they are not lost at the school. or if we need to go virtual with the pandemic.  Thank you for making these changes.  I have always loved Scholastic book club.",,
Disappointed,How do I enroll children with different teachers? I tried to a child to my account but was not asked for the teacher code.  I could not figure how to see a classroom wishlist,,
Very Satisfied,Love the online option - so easy and fast!  Thank you!,,
Very Satisfied,Great site!,,
Very Satisfied,"Was a little overwhelming to sort through the flyers and try to present options to my kindergartner, but got it done!",,
Very Satisfied,Much easier to use this year.,,
Very Disappointed,Congratulations- my new password for this site contains the words This is stupid.  I have been a parent ordering books for almost 10 years and the absolutely ridiculous crap I had to go through to log back in after forgetting my password was exceedingly frustrating.  What a waste of my time.  Next time I will go to the bookstore or library to get my kids’ books.  The drive will take less time.  I couldn’t even complete my order before this stupid survey popped up.,,
Very Satisfied,I love being able to submit my child's order and pay for it online and have it shipped  to his classroom teacher!!,,
Very Satisfied,"Wish entire book orders could arrive at the same time. I get partial orders for some kids, and it’s hard to send fulfilled orders home with just some kids, and partial orders with others. I try to keep partial orders until I have all their books, but have to refer to the order history online to see if their order is complete or if there are more coming.  Takes a bit more time to,cross check the orders.",,
Satisfied,"Still getting used to using the online, but I was not able to get back to the teachers list after I chose some books. Not sure if that's a user issue but I wish there was a visible tab to get back to that after making selections and checking my cart to see what my total was at. my intention was to spend 25 and then spend the $5 on a book for the teacher and I could figure out where her requests were.",,
Very Satisfied,very easy and user friendly,,
Very Satisfied,"I appreciate the opportunity to offer my students a variety of books to purchase.  I would like to see ""small group"" sets of books for my new grade level to purchase.",,
Neutral,"After selecting a book description, it's difficult to get back to the page where you can select a different flyer.    I would prefer more individual books instead of a pack of several.",,
Neutral,I wanted to see more books beyond my child's grade.  The options were confusing to figure out and looked like that same books over and over again.,,
Very Satisfied,Having the paper order form from the teacher makes searching for books and putting in order quick and easy!,,
Disappointed,"After my order as a parent, the email gave me a link to check the status of my order.   However, I an unable to find anywhere on this site where I can do that!",,
Disappointed,"First, what the heck is the difference between a book fair and a book store? Why does it still look like I'm benefiting my niece's old school from past years, when I tried to sign up with my daughter's new school? Your flyers stopped loading for me after I'd looked at several. The cart doesn't have an easily visible total... I have to scroll all the way to the bottom, which feels like extra work when I just want to know where things stand before I add more books (or subtract some).",,
Satisfied,I couldn't add the free book from the mobile site it wouldn't let me scroll down to submit.  So i had to pull it up on my laptop to get the free book saved.,,
Satisfied,"Last year when the orders arrived, each child's order was printed on a tear apart slip. This made it easy and efficient to sort large orders and ensure that all of the correct books were sent with each child. We also were able to send this slip with the books as a receipt showing the parent that they had received all we have record of them ordering,    This order I received had three pages of books listed and some of the student orders were in different places on different pages,    If possible, the tear apart slips or a place online to reference the orders would be great!  Thanks for all you do,  Melanie Coffelt",,
Satisfied,Wondered what to do about out of stock orders.  I plan to return the student's money,,
Satisfied,"I entered the code on the header (READS), but when I tried to check out it says the code has expired.",,
Very Satisfied,I absolutely love this company. I know that last year you had difficulties that were outside your reach. But this year I've already placed one order and received it in record time. Keep up the great job.,,
Satisfied,"I like the books available. I like that you can find books by age, grade and level.",,
Disappointed,"Signing in to do book fairs vs bookclubs and then being a teacher in one school, having two kids in another, another kid in another, and then being the Book Fair chair for a different school. It's so difficult! I've already messaged for assistance.",,
Very Satisfied,Just checking up on my class order which is due later this week.,,
Neutral,"Even after typing in the title of the book that I was looking for, the site took a long time to find the item.",,
Very Satisfied,Website is easy to use.,,
Satisfied,"The book that I wanted to order is out of stock.  No details as to when it will be back in stock.  Usually, companies would send you information when the item is back in stock.  Disappointed.",,
Satisfied,unsure how to submit student paper order with ease. Also thought it was silly there is a shipping limit. Should be free shipping for all,,
Satisfied,"I don't see many books on the home page of the website.  For overall browsing purposes, I prefer to flooded with options as a consumer.",,
Neutral,very smooth website for a technologically challenged individual such as myself.,,
Neutral,"the promotion code,advertised all over the site is not working",,
Very Satisfied,Would not let me enter free book selection on a $176.00 order.,,
Very Disappointed,"If you are going to advertise a promotion like READS, you should take it down if it's no longer available, which is the message that appears in my cart when I am ordering well over the required amount.   You're being very misleading in your advertising.   But for supporting our teacher through the promotion you are giving to teachers whose parents place orders before September 30th, this experience makes me not want to shop from Scholastic again.",,
Very Disappointed,This was such a terrible experience.  What books come in the five book bonus pack? How do you pay for the dollar books?  How does the teacher  purchase books for the classroom from the flyer?  What are thee bonus points for? If I send you the paper order how do I know who gets what? Come on scholastic- make it stress free for the teacher too!,,
Very Satisfied,Looking forward to ordering book for this school year.,,
Satisfied,I love that the teachers get a book for the class!,,

Very Satisfied,I found a book to add to the wish list. I will likely order it when I make my next book order.,,

Neutral,"i searched the graphic novel of i survived the attacks of september 11, 2001 and nothing came up",,
Very Satisfied,I will most likely submit an order this month. The only reason I didn't do it today is because I am waiting for my class due date before I submit.,,
Very Satisfied,"My class and I love Scholastic Book Clubs! I know shipping was a nightmare during covid but I ordered many books last year for my class and parents and I both had an easy time doing so. The books eventually got to us :) I hope this year is a bit quicker with shipping. I really encourage my parents to utilize these cheap prices. I call it BOOK DAY when our orders come in and I get books for everyone so no one feels left out. Each month it is a BIG deal to get our scholastic book orders in! Thank you!    Nicole Jones  First Grade Teacher  Hampton, NJ  UTES",,
Very Satisfied,super easy to find books and place order,,
Satisfied,"Since the pandemic, I have not been getting the student flyers sent to school.  I REALLY want them to generate more orders.  PLEASE send them to school.  I emailed last year and sat on hold for a time to talk to a Rep about this and still have not received the paper flyers.",,
Satisfied,"I'd love Free shipping, or some bonus to get free shipping.  I can't control whether many of my students order books or not.  With a $25 minimum, I have to send the book orders home less often to be sure more kids order books, so that I don't have to pay for shipping.  I'm just not willing to spend my money to pay shipping for my students' books.    Maybe there could be a minimum order amount for individual families to order and have it sent to school or home??",,
Very Satisfied,I placed an order for my class yesterday 9/16/2022 by phone. I did not have any online orders. However a student placed an on line order this morning so I placed this order today. It was very easy to place this on line order.,,

Very Satisfied,"Just wondering if parents could be prompted to select a free book when their order is over $25.  I have a family that earned a free book, but didn't make a selection.  It would be nice if they could be prompted for these rewards just like teacher's have on their checkout page.",,
Very Disappointed,"The system would not allow me to place and order and ship to my home.  The children are in the middle of a nasty divorce, and I would like to have the books shipped to my home.  If the father receives the books, he will not return them.  Additionally, I order other items for Christmas and Birthdays, as well as for other grandchildren.  I would like those to be a surprise.  The system should allow me the option to ship to my home and pay for it.",,
Disappointed,"The links provided on the flyer didn’t work. I had to search and find the site , navigation was frustrating.",,

Satisfied,Browsing to look at the books circled from flyer will come back to complete my order later.,,
Very Satisfied,I couldn't complete my order because one of the student order was out of stock and I had to contact the parent to see if they wanted to change their order or get reimbursed. I used the chat feature for the first time.  I really like that feature.,,
Neutral,The only issue was having the Feedback and Live Chat on the right side made it difficult to move up and down the page on my laptop.,,
Very Disappointed,signing up i did not get points or neither did the person who shared. Also the sign up was really buggy.,,
Very Satisfied,Much easier to order online than it is to submit orders the old fashioned way like I used to have to do when I was in school!,,
Satisfied,Free book selection should be larger,,
Very Satisfied,We like searching by flyer and by other lists. Thanks!,,

Satisfied,I want to know how to get flyers,,
Very Satisfied,Great way to support our teachers and enhance literacy skills!,,
Satisfied,trying to update my grade level to kindergarten so I could share the link with parents. I used the chat feature and the associate checked it for me. It was kindergarten on one screen but still said 1st on the other. Associate checked and confirmed profile on your side and suggested I clear my cache on my end.,,
Neutral,how about some tutorial videos on how to...?,,
Very Satisfied,Scholastic has always been special to me and my students. Ordering is easy for my families and myself as the teacher.  We love scholastic!,,
Neutral,"It is just not easy to find things on your website. Since I work on line, I need to be ale to quickly and easily see if  my students have made orders so that I can submit them.  That is not an easy thing to find.",,
Neutral,"I ordered some books for my younger son because his teacher sent home a book order. So I connected him to his teacher's class. I then did the same with my older son because he wanted some books as well, but his teacher never actually gave us a book order or mentioned that she was putting one in.  I was just able to find her name in the website when I went to connect him to a teacher. Today, my younger son came home with his book order, but my older son did not. My older son's order still just says ""Submitted to teacher."" Is there something else that I need to do?",,
Neutral,I appreciated the pop-up to add items directly to the cart from the home page.,,
Satisfied,DON'T SEE HOW TO SHARE FLYER WITH A PARENT,,
Very Satisfied,I like that parents can order online under the class code!!,,
Very Disappointed,When I click sign in a white blank box comes up and I am unable to sign in.  I can sign in at my school but not at home. I tried connecting to my hotspot- that didn't work either. Why can I not sign in at home?,,
Very Satisfied,Prices are too high. Not willing to pay $6-8 for a paperback book.,,
Very Satisfied,I love Scholastic!!,,
Neutral,"Just hard to find something that I think she will enjoy, thats at her level. Shes 8 and a good reader but many books seem to young for her (picture books) and she doesn't enjoy graphic novels. I only want  to buy books that will get reread,  otherwise we just go to the local library  cheaper for me and less clutter at home.",,
Very Satisfied,Wish it would let me order for my 8th grader and just send them home or to the school.,,
Satisfied,The only difficulty is shopping or making Teacher Selections by level. I wish there was a way to search books by reading level.,,
Satisfied,I thought this was pretty straight forward. My only thing was that it took me a moment to find the button to see all books in the age group I selected rather than just a sample of what was available. Once I saw that link everything else was easy.,,
Very Satisfied,"My customer # has changed, and the number of spaces for my customer # is different than what is on the envelope.",,
Very Satisfied,"When I tried to download my Family Letter, it would not open to the letter. The site stated it was not found.",,
Very Satisfied,I see there is now a minimum $25 in order to receive the free shipping. There are times I have had only a couple parents order and my total amount is under this. I as a teacher would NOT want to incur the $6.50 S&H fee.,,
Very Satisfied,always an easy process to order books. the kids get so excited,,
Satisfied,If it is possible to look at books by theme a little easier it would be nice.,,
Satisfied,not enough books displayed on a page when looking at fiction books.  Too many pages to click through.,,
Very Disappointed,And where’s the pre-k or early childhood site? I tried to order but I was told by the website that I was wrong,,
Satisfied,When selecting free books it would be nice to see the covers and authors.,,
Very Satisfied,I retired and then came back part time and I am so excited that my new school allows Scholastic books clubs!!  Thank you!,,
Very Satisfied,For holidays I like to purchase my students a book such as Spookley the Square Pumpkin or Twas the Night Before Christmas.  The last few years many of these popular books are only offered in book bundles instead of individually.  Could you please also offer books individually so that we may purchase these classics for our entire class.,,
Satisfied,"There was a $1 books offer that opened to me, but when I switched pages I couldn't find it again. I was going to go back and get some but couldn't access it easily. Otherwise no problems.",,

Very Satisfied,I love it,,
Very Satisfied,site is user friendly and so convenient,,
Very Satisfied,Hoping the delayed shipping issues of last year are no longer around! Kids always excited for books to arrive and the 6 weeks of last year was a bit long to wait!,,
Very Disappointed,I have just placed my last order with your company.  You failed to honor your advertised rewards for teachers when students place orders.  I'm done with your company.  My time is too valuable to do your advertising for free.  No more!  Do not send me any more flyers.  I am done!,,

Neutral,I’m also a teacher so I love scholastic books,,
Neutral,"the suggestions of books are very small, and it should have an option to search books by themes.",,
Disappointed,It would not let me spend the $5 in free books. We picked a $2 book and a $3 book but it would not let me order the two books.,,
Very Disappointed,I am frankly disgusted by Scholastic's false promises of free books for teachers.  I am far to busy to waste my time on nonsense.  I will inform my classroom parents that Scholastic has repeatedly failed to uphold its promises to reward teachers with free books for student purchase therefore I will no longer distribute monthly book order forms.  They can go to retail book shops in the future.,,
Satisfied,"I'm still learning how to navigate to what I need. Sometimes, it's not as intuitive as I'd like. Overall, I've had a positive experience with the site.",,

Satisfied,"I'm always checking back on the site for new reading packs in our spanish classrooms.  We need more ""ready to read"" books for grades TK-3rd.",,
Satisfied,Some books are not competitively priced and are cheaper on amazon- so I will always check if they are not 2.00 or more I'll buy from scholastic but sometimes you are 5.00 more and I can't justify it.,,
Very Satisfied,"Love all the opportunites to earn extra points and books!  I like when you send birthday or bonus in the summer. I don't like having to remember to save the email or write them down, but I try!    I've been working on encouraging familes to support books/reading. The economy limits, but glad at least some can. I use my library to supplement.  Many teachers at my school already use Scholastic book orders or not interested, to I can't really recommend anymore.",,
Neutral,thank you,,
Disappointed,Please allow for author searching and linking. Subjects as well. Sort filter features by price and reading level while I'm dreaming.,,

Neutral,still deciding what to order,,
Very Disappointed,Stop sending me emails and stop producing sooooo many flyers that I simply recycle. Stop!!!!!,,
Disappointed,It is just not user friendly. Lots of scrolling. and the information you're looking for is not really in the place you are looking for it to be in.,,
Neutral,"I had a student send a check and an order, like they're supposed to.  One of the items he ordered is apparently out of stock.  Instead of a backorder sheet of stickers, it won't even let me place that order.  Now I've had to email his parents and ask if they want me to send the check back to be re-done or if I should choose a new $6 book.  Thanks for adding extra work on my plate Scholastic.",,
Neutral,I am not getting notified when a parent makes an order.  I have called about this issue and it does not get resolved.  I do get an email when the box is on its way.  But i need to know when a parent places an order,,
Very Satisfied,Waiting for teachers book list and will be buying. And getting some for my friends’ kids. I’m so excited.,,
Neutral,Code READS is not working. About to just not bother and not order these books.,,
Very Satisfied,Still plan to submit an order but wanted to verify the books in my cart my child.,,
Satisfied,Yesterday I submitted a student online order and mailed a student order and today I had another student online order. Since my orders were submitted on different days I was not able to receive any bonus points or rewards. Is there any way to get those credits?,,
Neutral,"I entered a discount code as offered and instructed, but it did not take.",,
Neutral,I still appreciate the tactile sense of browsing the printed Scholastic book order flyer.,,
Neutral,"When on mobile, hard to find how to order for book club to benefit classroom.",,
Satisfied,Sign in period is too short.  Most times when browsing I need to come back and find I've been signed out.  It's just annoying to sign back in is all.,,
Very Satisfied,very easy to use,,
Very Satisfied,"I love scholastic, but I hope there are no delays like there were last year!",,
Neutral,Website and selection are pretty sparse,,
Disappointed,"You were out of stock on over $80 worth of books towards my order. Now I have to contact all the parents and have them  write new checks, pick out new books  or discuss options. It is not a good look for the first few weeks of school. Also, I lose out on bonus points and book picks!",,
Disappointed,"Everytime I chat with someone, they end the chat before I can even respond. It is very frustrating. It happened just now with Yvonne and has happened each time I have chatted with someone on several occasions. They tell me their solution and then just end the chat. They don't even ask if there is anything else I need, or even provide a normal response time for me to respond each time they send a response or question to me. Can you please relay this along as customer service is getting a bad rep for this. Thanks so much.",,
Neutral,"I don't think it's the most user friendly site. Also, I don't appreciate how Scholastic has raised the price so much that most of our families can't afford to get the books anymore.",,
Satisfied,"When used the promotion ""READS"" to get a free book for an order over $25, I was unable to search for titles. For example, I would type in ""pete"" for pete the cat books, however the search revealed no results. However when I deleted the title and just selected ""kindergarten"" grade, pete the cat books appeared as possible options.",,
Very Disappointed,"This has nothing to do with the website, but I am very disheartened that you charging shipping for student orders! I really don't think you should charge for teacher orders either.  I promote your books (for free I might add) and now I have a student that can not order because you are charging shipping for his books because his total is under 25.00. We all know it is getting harder and harder to get kids/parents to even order anymore and now this makes it even harder for those who do! I work in a small district and I have few kids that even order anymore, so getting to the 25.00 is hard. What if I had a student who can only afford a small amount and they were ordering all the books they could in the $1, $2, or $5 section? This is very sad to say the least and I am probably going to do away with even offering the orders and promoting them in my classroom. My student is no longer able to order the two books she wants because she can not cover the shipping charges. I am very disappointed!",,
Very Satisfied,Great!,,
Very Satisfied,Thanks for the great book selection!,,
Satisfied,It is annoying to me that the site works best in landscape over portrait on my iPad. I usually forget to turn it.,,
Very Satisfied,The site has been great. I'm just waiting on some more info and then I will place my order.,,
Satisfied,"It was difficult to find a ""free book"".  The one I chose for $5, the website said was not eligible.  Don't know why it wasn't.",,
Satisfied,It wouldn't let me enter my $5 free book.,,
Disappointed,"I have been a member of scholastic for over 30 years. The quality of reading of your product has gone down, in my opinion. There are not enough classic stories, too many graphic novels, and silly stories (Dog man, etc..) and these kind of books do not make my students smarter readers. I know these are the type of books that sell, but , in my opinion, they lower Scholastic's standards.",,
Very Satisfied,Everything worked very smoothly!,,
Neutral,"Site was a little difficult to understand, originally did order through parent site, took me a little while to figure out I needed to check out on book club site so my child's teacher would get credit, would be easier if I could enter her classroom code on profile and it was automatically entered when I check out instead of trying to figure out which site I need to enter my order on. Very confusing.",,
Disappointed,"I simply wanted to change the number of fliers I'm receiving since I have a larger class this year. The person I did chat with told me I needed to go the the ""arrow"". When I asked what arrow, she said scroll down to the bottom of the screen, for teachers, and select catalogs. There I find I need to order specific catalogs for a one-time order. I've been teaching 15 years and have placed scholastic orders each of those years. This didn't used to be so difficult.",,
Very Disappointed,I couldnt use the READS coupon code.,,
Satisfied,"I am a retired teacher and had an account of my own for my classroom. I now want to purchase books for my grandson's teacher but when I enter my email address, I am taken to my teacher account, and the site won't let me create a parent account. I don't want to purchase unless the teacher gets credit.",,
Very Satisfied,I will place my personal order when students have placed their orders.,,
Satisfied,"The search functions are a little antiquated, but I was able to complete, thanks!",,
Satisfied,We used to have a warehouse right in our community.  When it shut down last year the delay on getting books WAS HUGE!  I decided not to order last year.  I am going to try again and hope that parents get their orders sooner than later.,,
Satisfied,I love the holiday books,,
Very Satisfied,We love when the scholastic flyers come home from school!,,
Very Satisfied,"The updates you are constantly making to the website are amazing and much appreciated. Each time I order, it is so much better. Thank you!",,
Satisfied,I have asked for a 4th grade flyer but have not received one- most of my parents need the paper flyer,,
Very Satisfied,Excellent!  Much easier to use than the old format of the site.,,
Satisfied,"We really wanted to purchase individual titles of the Owl Diaries, but they were not available.",,
Satisfied,"i wasn't able to find a way to search by topic, like self regulation.  I just had to hope it came up.  You should have a tab for kids on spectrum.  Maybe you do but it wasn't obvious.",,
Neutral,I remember being a kid and loving scholastic book days when I got to buy books to read! While it's not exactly the same I did have fun going through the flyer with my son and picking out books he thought were interesting!,,
Very Satisfied,Scholastic's website is very user-friendly and I appreciate that!,,
Satisfied,Where do I mail my payment,,
Neutral,"The website is sending my 4th grader's books to my 1st grader's teacher even though I signed them in and ordered separately using their own classroom codes.  It's not a huge deal for us because my kids will both get their books either way, but I really want each teacher to get the points for the right kid.  I'd also like my 4th grader to get his own order, because it's more fun to have them delivered to you in class instead of getting them later from your little brother.  Really  frustrating!",,
Very Satisfied,"Some trouble logging in - didn't accept password, but overall easier than usual.  As I've said before your site doesn't do well with Mozilla and other browsers that focus on privacy which is annoying as I have to use chrome or edge - whichever will work that day.  Also, my biggest pain is trying to enter the due dates.  Often the Drop-down calendar will not register my date.  It would be preferable to have an option to type in a date.  Thank you - hoping things are running more smoothly this year.",,
Very Disappointed,It will not let me order books. Nothing shows in my cart,,
Neutral,I had to reload the page 3 times as a weird box kept coming up. I need to have flyers sent to me as I never got any and would like to make a class order. I can't find how to have flyers sent on your website.,,
Very Disappointed,"I hate having to create accounts for every website out there.  Why can't you just let us enter our information and make a purchase as a ""guest""?  I hate this so much that I have actually not made purchases from you in the past because of it, and I am undecided now if I'll make a purchase tonight.  I came to this website tonight with full intention of placing an order, but now I might not.",,
Very Satisfied,The Scholastic Book Clubs website is very easy to follow.,,
Satisfied,"It is difficult to get to the correct page---the clubs.scholastic is not easy to find just by Googling ""Scholastic"".  That would be my only recommendation is to make the clubs easier to navigate to from the main page.",,
Neutral,Trying to apply discounts.,,
Very Satisfied,"if possible filters allowing me too look at subjects per age.  For example... fears/anxiety & age  options with 'where is my monster'.  Also maybe select value packs as alternate purchases when you select a particular book.   I found the above example after searching examples, then put it directly in to see if you had the book as an option.  After I completed my order I discovered there was a value pack with another similar book.",,
Very Satisfied,Very easy to navigate and user friendly.,,
Neutral,What my child wanted was out of stock,,
Very Satisfied,I like how the site keeps track of earned rewards so I don't have to figure it out on my own with codes etc.,,

Very Satisfied,I love how easy it is to navigate.  Thank you!,,
Neutral,"I put items in my cart, but the site would not let me log in so I could buy the books I wanted to purchase. I had an account last year and my grandson s now in first grade, so i need to chanfge classrooms, which i did, but then I could not log in. I tried to create a new account, but could not do that either. I am not impressed with your website a the moment.",,
Neutral,I went to scholastic.com and it was not intuitive and difficult to find how to submit an order through my kid's teacher and use the fliers,,

Neutral,The phone number to call in said it could not be completed at this time. I sent an email. I will see what happens.,,
Disappointed,"Why are you selling books that normalize harsh parenting methods that humiliate and shame children?  While browsing, I saw a book called ""David Gets in Trouble"" that showed a child on the cover sitting in a corner.  The 1950s called and they would like their degrading treatment of children back.  Additionally, I saw you are selling the ""How Do Dinosaurs..."" series which also normalizes emotionally aggressive relationships between parents and children.  Families have problems, yes.  Please do not normalize parental mistreatment of children and CONDITIONAL (rather than unconditional) love.  Please sell books that depict healthy methods of parents guiding their children morally and ethically.  Children being mistreated by their parents don't always realize that what their parents are doing is not healthy.  Normalizing harsh parenting through literature does not help.  It can take years for children to realize that their parents mistreated them and they should not repeat the same patterns",,
Very Satisfied,"I've been a big fan of Scholastic Book Clubs for many years and appreciate the work the company does and how they support literacy not only at my center, but across the country.",,
Satisfied,I tried to pull up the2nd & 4th grade flyers to view. they never came up even after I clicked the help if  having trouble,,
Very Satisfied,Love scholastic!! Kids need to hold books.,,
Very Disappointed,I was searching for the book order that I made for my son early in the year (2020 - 2021) . I have never received this order or an explanation as to why not. I will make no future purchases. When I searched for my order after logging in. it said I had no orders. What the heck happened!,,

Very Satisfied,The site was easy to use and I placed an order with no issues.,,
Satisfied,I am still a bit hesitant after last year's first order took over two months.  I shared with families this month but if orders do not come in within 2 weeks we will not send home to parents again.,,
Very Satisfied,The digital flyer wouldn't always come up,,
Satisfied,I am just browsing to see what is new and available.  I am the grandparent and will have the books shipped.,,
Satisfied,"Not really a difficulty, but I would have liked to be able to specify ""grandparent"" rather than parent.",,
Satisfied,"Overall, a good experience however the prices are a little high!",,
Very Satisfied,Very easy,,
Satisfied,"I was looking for a way to request paper, book order catalogs to hand out to my students.",,
Satisfied,It would be great if you could search by lexile/reading level.  Or even if you could easily access flyers from other grades as my child is reading above her grade level.,,
Satisfied,"It's not clear when we will receive the book? With online orders, I like to know when to check back in in case something gets lost.",,

Neutral,"on 9-9 I submitted orders for Emery and Alcie.  Alcies ordered was delivered today, But   Emerys was not and I do not see it on the site.",,
Very Satisfied,I loved that we got a free book from the $5 page!,,

Very Satisfied,Looking for classroom books and books for my family. I will submit class order tomorrow.,,
Neutral,Last year I stopped ordering because it was a mess.  If it goes back to the previous year I would love to use it again.  Plus all four kindergarten teachers had a bill for the whole school year and our PTO had paid it.  I gave you scores based on last year.,,
Disappointed,The process of entering my students new teacher took more time than it should have and finally someone had to do it that works for scholastic.  It should be a simple process to change teachers at the beginning of the new year.,,
Very Satisfied,My customer number is not the same number I've used for the last 35 years??????,,
Very Satisfied,Site is easy yo navigate,,
Very Satisfied,"I was able to find what I needed. The item numbers were very helpful with that. It was nice to get a free book with code--READS.     I think I get too many emails from the scholastic book club. In all honestly, it's the fliers that I look at before getting books. Not that I'd never want emails, but I just get too many emails, so I reach a point where I just start unsubscribing from groups.",,
Very Satisfied,I will be placing an order tomorrow and I wanted to look at any changes to the site.,,
Neutral,I wish the $1 books would come back. Some teachers can not afford to buy $75 worth of book before we can access the $1 books. Its hard enough to afford a $1 book for each of my students each month. I hate that I haven't been able to provide my students with more book this last year like I did my first year.,,

Very Satisfied,"Using the site is simple, which I can appreciate!",,
Very Disappointed,"I ran out of during this visit to the website, but I will be placing my order shortly. :)",,
Neutral,"It was very hard to find the correct place to go. First, I was on the generic ""Scholastic"" website and while I connected to the school, I was not able to connect to my child's teacher. Shipping to the teacher's classroom didn't work. When I tried the chat feature for help, the session timed out and I never got help. I eventually found the correct ""Book Club"" site and entered books straight from the flyer from school.     So overall...tricky to navigate the website.",,

Very Satisfied,"Biggest challenge was figuring out which books were in a boxed series. I was shopping for the Magic Tree House series and needed a specific ""next"" box set. I couldn't easily distinguish which set was the correct one for me to select. The numbers were not listed in the title of the product.",,
Very Satisfied,"I couldn't remember my password but if I had known the ""requirements"" I would've been able to remember it.  Maybe it would be helpful to know how many characters the passwords are?",,
Very Disappointed,"The flyer from the teacher, does NOT match on-line.",,
Satisfied,"It can be hard to find books even with the search feature.  For instance I typed in ""Babysitters Club"" and it only offered me the 5 book pack, but I knew there was an individual book available.",,
Very Disappointed,I was searching for the book order that I made for my son early in the year (2020 - 2021) . I have never received this order or an explanation as to why not. I will make no future purchases. When I searched for my order after logging in. it said I had no orders. What the heck happened!,,
Very Disappointed,Unable to get to the Cary to purchase.,,
Satisfied,"It would be nice to be able to easily share a child's wishlist, with easy connection to the teacher's  class code#.",,
Very Disappointed,"After the multiple poor experiences I had last year, I am not participating in book orders in my classroom this year.",,
Neutral,"Had been calling to clarify my order. Still missing a book I ordered back on May 20, 2022.  I did not appreciate that a call back was never made from Scholastic.  I had to log in, call, send a message and finally, took me submitting a chat before I had my questions answered.",,
Very Satisfied,Is there a better way to search for all non-book items that are available to purchase? My middle schooler likes the posters and other items that are usually available during the book fairs. I was unable to locate any of those items during my search.,,
Satisfied,My child's teacher was listed at her former school. I let her know so she can update it.,,
Neutral,"For books that are part of a series, I wish you would say which number it is. As an example, I know my son likes The Bad Guys, but I don't know which numbers you have for sale.",,
Very Satisfied,It sent me straight to the survey before I could order. I will do so now.,,
Very Satisfied,All around great,,
Very Satisfied,Excellent choice of books and great prices.  Thanks for making ordering so easy.,,
Very Satisfied,"Christon was very helpful. I didn't get to tell them because  I clicked something and the chat disappeared from screen, though  I heard a couple extra messages.",,
Very Satisfied,Easy and quick to order!,,
Satisfied,"I think it's great that we can select a child's name when we have multiple children in the Scholastic System. I like that feature in the cart and the ability to add to their wishlist. The struggle that I have with that, is that when earning free books, we may spend $25 on each child, but we would still only receive one free book. It makes it more effective for me to submit two orders so they can each pick their own free book, but I know it's more costly for you.     In addition, the books and series that my children like most were out of stock. That prompted me not to submit an order today. It seems that the books or series that my children want (and within a price range I am willing to spend with each book order) always seem to be out of stock.",,
Satisfied,Site was quick and easy to navigate.,,
Satisfied,the flyers are glitchy,,
Very Satisfied,Site is very easy to navigate. I love that we can create a wish list for next time!,,
Satisfied,Some difficulty finding the location for the classroom code.,,
Very Disappointed,I am frustrated that the last two orders I made were canceled and not by me!  I choose to have our orders come to my home because we are within a high school that does not give us our mail.,,
Satisfied,Not all books are available that are available on the regular website of scholastic,,
Neutral,The site is always so easy to use!,,
Very Satisfied,"I was very happy to have immediate help from ""Ronda"" on the live chat. She was able to find the information I needed in a timely manner and was quite courteous.    I was a little surprised to find that I could not look up the amount in my child's E-wallet without the help of Ronda, I have the tendency to think I've done something, but in fact just thought about doing it and I needed to make absolute sure that my daughter wouldn't be showing up on book fair day, unable to purchase anything with her class.      Other than the ability to check the amount in your child's E-wallet easily, everything else ran smoothly.",,
Satisfied,I had a hard time trying to change my password.,,
Disappointed,"I am unable to find books via searching. I searched for the title  ""Marcus Makes a Movie"" and the author ""Kevin Hart,"" among others and the books in your flyer did not come up. I used to work in a library so I know how to search books. I was able to use the item number, but it's absurd that using the titles of the book does not work. I am very disappointed with how poor your site operates.",,
Neutral,Thank you guys for all you do.,,
Satisfied,Will be placing order later today,,
Satisfied,"It is hard to find the book club site versus the regular scholastic site.  Going forward, I believe I figured it out, but why separate the two so distinctly?  Thanks!",,
Satisfied,Sometimes the digital flyers would not load and I would have to keep refreshing the page. Other than that I am a big Scholastic fan and love ordering books!,,
Neutral,difficult to figure out where to make changes to account.  Site not clear.,,
Neutral,I started ordering under my name and it didn't automatically connect me with my son's teacher. I had to notice the price difference to the flyer and then went into the club section and was able to get the pricing I had for the flyer.,,
Satisfied,I like that I received an email when a family orders books online.,,
Neutral,It wasn't clear that to order online we had to connect to a teacher. We were given a code to use but no instructions so when entering the website it was a bit difficult to navigate.,,
Neutral,"On the main Scholastic page, there should be something to tell you to go to the Book Clubs section if you have a class code.",,
Very Disappointed,"Added items to the general scholastic purchasing site.  however, didn't know this wouldn't link me to the book clubs directly.  book clubs has a lot fewer options.  ended up buying at amazon.",,
Satisfied,"I like being able to see tons and tons of books, but I wish there was an option to search based on price and not by grade or age. I really like the selection of suggested books at the bottom of the page after you click on a book. I feel like there are so many books I am missing and struggle to be able to search appropriately on my phone.",,
Satisfied,Overall good experience.  I felt like the book recommendations were a bit on the young side.,,
Very Satisfied,Opened site and prepared for my children to choose their options. Very likely to come back. I remember being SO excited for Book Fairs and Book Clubs as a kid in school. It was definitely a highlight of elementary and even middle school!,,
Satisfied,none,,
Satisfied,I've struggled for years with the cc payment method on this site. Mostly around saving a cc/adding a new cc.,,
Satisfied,The coupon code for a free book expired before the book order is even due. That’s frustrating!,,
Satisfied,I had to put in my card info a couple of times before it would accept it - kept saying invalid code. I had to enter things in a certain order.,,
Very Satisfied,"Took a long time to load, just closed the page and re-opened it about an hour later and all is good.",,
Satisfied,I wish you could see a photo of the books that are available with the code READS (Because apparently I literally want to judge a book by it's cover??).,,
Very Satisfied,"This was the fastest, EASIEST book order I have ever completed.  I usually have to call you to have somebody WALK ME through the process, but this time--------it was a CHARM!!  Sooooo-keep up the good work!!  (Of having an order form that flows logically!!)",,
Very Satisfied,Flyers take a long time to load,,
Very Satisfied,"very user friendly, fast & efficient",,
Very Satisfied,Anxious to provide opportunities for students to buy books.,,
Satisfied,The $10 to spend right now window was not available and I couldn't complete my order,,
Satisfied,"When a book is out of stock, i should be able to put in on a watchlist or something.",,
Very Satisfied,I appreciate the work taken to make Scholastic great again! Thank you!,,
Satisfied,Please add filters to narrow down search. Grade/Price/theme all on same page.,,
Neutral,"I am not so sure how to enter my students and get flyers to parents. I am going to ask a coworker to help, who has used the site this year.",,
Satisfied,Some of the wording prices were overlapping. I couldn't read what was written in these areas.,,
Satisfied,Looking for graphic novels to try and interest a young boy to read.,,
Very Satisfied,not complete with my order. Did find letters for parents. Love them,,
Very Disappointed,"Page isn't formatted to view on Android mobile. The page is too big for mobile viewing. Can't see all the books when scrolling, it ""skips"" over half of them.",,
Very Disappointed,This website is goddawful. I can’t figure out how to make an order and your tutorial only shows me how to send reminders and links to friends and family. I’ve been here ten minutes and I can’t figure it out. Fix your website. It sucks.,,
