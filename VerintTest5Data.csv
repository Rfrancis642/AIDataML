Disappointed,"Everytime I chat with someone, they end the chat before I can even respond. It is very frustrating. It happened just now with Yvonne and has happened each time I have chatted with someone on several occasions. They tell me their solution and then just end the chat. They don't even ask if there is anything else I need, or even provide a normal response time for me to respond each time they send a response or question to me. Can you please relay this along as customer service is getting a bad rep for this. Thanks so much.",,
Disappointed,I have now filled out the request for paper flyers twice. Please follow through and send them soon.,,
Disappointed,"I simply wanted to change the number of fliers I'm receiving since I have a larger class this year. The person I did chat with told me I needed to go the the ""arrow"". When I asked what arrow, she said scroll down to the bottom of the screen, for teachers, and select catalogs. There I find I need to order specific catalogs for a one-time order. I've been teaching 15 years and have placed scholastic orders each of those years. This didn't used to be so difficult.",,
Disappointed,It would not let me spend the $5 in free books. We picked a $2 book and a $3 book but it would not let me order the two books.,,
Disappointed,Scholastic has not been helpful......we are stilled owed books from last school year.,,
Disappointed,The process of entering my students new teacher took more time than it should have and finally someone had to do it that works for scholastic.  It should be a simple process to change teachers at the beginning of the new year.,,
Disappointed,VERINT TEST,,
Disappointed,"Very frustrated-   Put $80 books in a cart, only to discover that's the ""retail side"" so I can't buy them from my son's class teacher book club.  Started over - picked $30 worth of goods, entered the READS promo code for free book and got no credit or option to pick a $5 book.  Forget it.",,
Neutral,Always have a little trouble submitting my free book selection,,
Neutral,Book fair is tomorrow and my son's school does not come up.  I want to get him an eWallet but your system will not allow it without a book fair to tie it to...,,
Neutral,Code READS is not working. About to just not bother and not order these books.,,
Neutral,"Had been calling to clarify my order. Still missing a book I ordered back on May 20, 2022.  I did not appreciate that a call back was never made from Scholastic.  I had to log in, call, send a message and finally, took me submitting a chat before I had my questions answered.",,
Neutral,I am not getting notified when a parent makes an order.  I have called about this issue and it does not get resolved.  I do get an email when the box is on its way.  But i need to know when a parent places an order,,
Neutral,"I am not so sure how to enter my students and get flyers to parents. I am going to ask a coworker to help, who has used the site this year.",,
Neutral,I am sad that there are no longer packs of 10 books for $10.  I used these packs for all students to get a free book.,,
Neutral,I couldn't find the place to select my $10 in free books :(,,
Neutral,I did not see my ewallet for the fair tomorrow,,
Neutral,"I entered a discount code as offered and instructed, but it did not take.",,
Neutral,I have parents who place book orders after I have submitted the order.  It is less than 12 hours after I have done so and the parents are told their child's order will be shipped in October.  He then calls and is on the phone for over 30 minutes.  Why do you make it so difficult to place orders?  My class order is still processing so why is it even an issue?    Please email me.  I had another parent place an order a day later.  Will that order be sent with my class order?,,
Neutral,I liked that both children's orders were combined into one billing transaction. However both children should have had the ability to take advantage of the READ free book code. But only one child was able to select a free book.,,
Neutral,"i searched the graphic novel of i survived the attacks of september 11, 2001 and nothing came up",,
Neutral,I still appreciate the tactile sense of browsing the printed Scholastic book order flyer.,,
Neutral,im still searching for books,,
Neutral,"It's not clear on your website for orders paid by check whether or not to include the paper order form.  Also, the Business Reply envelopes I'm sent with our flyer have the Scholastic Book Clubs' zip code as 45273-8504  The zip code on your website is different: 45263-0446 ... please correct.    ALSO ... why haven't we  received our regular paper flyers for October's order?",,
Neutral,Last year I stopped ordering because it was a mess.  If it goes back to the previous year I would love to use it again.  Plus all four kindergarten teachers had a bill for the whole school year and our PTO had paid it.  I gave you scores based on last year.,,
Neutral,Last year it took forever to get the books that is why I gave it a 6.  Faster to go to a bookstore or library.  however pre-covid I would have given a 10 as books were delivered FAST,,
Neutral,Looking for a connection to order flyers  sent to my school.  In previous years they were automatically sent to my school.  This year they  were not. I would like flyers for Early Childhood and Firefly.,,

Neutral,Searching for book in promo list,,
Neutral,still deciding what to order,,
Neutral,the number are not the same as in the flyer.,,
Neutral,The phone number to call in said it could not be completed at this time. I sent an email. I will see what happens.,,
Neutral,"the promotion code,advertised all over the site is not working",,
Neutral,"The website is sending my 4th grader's books to my 1st grader's teacher even though I signed them in and ordered separately using their own classroom codes.  It's not a huge deal for us because my kids will both get their books either way, but I really want each teacher to get the points for the right kid.  I'd also like my 4th grader to get his own order, because it's more fun to have them delivered to you in class instead of getting them later from your little brother.  Really  frustrating!",,
Neutral,"Three parents told me they placed an order, I dont' see it.",,
Neutral,Trying to apply discounts.,,
Neutral,Trying to look at prices to get an estimate for a book fair.,,
Neutral,Unable to find teacher resources I've used in the past to promote scholastic book clubs in my class. I don't see a ready made letter to send home or labels from front of flyers.,,
Neutral,Why is tax charged for a school order?,,
Neutral,Won't let me continue to check out!,,
Neutral,you don't save .50 on books ordering online and you have to pay tax.,,
Satisfied,Couldn't figure out how to order the free book,,
Satisfied,Diana finally help me get into the sight I needed. Thank you,,
Satisfied,Discount code did not work chat bot told me to sign off and back on which was annoying,,
Satisfied,Everything worked well.,,
Satisfied,Free book selection should be larger,,
Satisfied,I am surprised that my customer number was changed.  It was the same number for years.  Why did it change and did everything from my old account merge or do I have 2 accounts?,,
Satisfied,I believe I earned some free books but did not see a place to choose those books. This is the only time this has happened. I probably didn't see it.,,
Satisfied,I couldn't send the order to the other teacher.  I have two kids in the school.,,
Satisfied,I have asked for a 4th grade flyer but have not received one- most of my parents need the paper flyer,,
Satisfied,"I have not ordered anything for 3 yrs.  I was not teaching reading.  I am again now.  So, setting up my acct.   Lost all my Bonus Points.  sad...",,
Satisfied,I logged in today because I didn't receive my October catalogs.  So I'm requesting them now.  I figured they would be sent out automatically each month!!!,,
Satisfied,I need a tax exempt button,,
Satisfied,I need to make my status inactive.  I do not need any flyers right now and need to stop them from being mailed to me at my school.,,
Satisfied,"I think it's great that we can select a child's name when we have multiple children in the Scholastic System. I like that feature in the cart and the ability to add to their wishlist. The struggle that I have with that, is that when earning free books, we may spend $25 on each child, but we would still only receive one free book. It makes it more effective for me to submit two orders so they can each pick their own free book, but I know it's more costly for you.     In addition, the books and series that my children like most were out of stock. That prompted me not to submit an order today. It seems that the books or series that my children want (and within a price range I am willing to spend with each book order) always seem to be out of stock.",,
Satisfied,I think there should be a way to import emails from google so that teachers don't have to manually enter them all in!,,
Satisfied,I want to know how to get flyers,,
Satisfied,I wanted to use bonus points to buy a book but the system charged instead of using the bonus points. I ended up deleting the book.  Hopefully I can order it with the bonus points next month.,,
Satisfied,"I was looking for a way to request paper, book order catalogs to hand out to my students.",,
Satisfied,I wish the discount books were for teachers who didn't have to spend $75.  It would benefit my class who are limited to ordering books due to budgets!,,
Satisfied,I wish there are more and better options in the Bonus Catalog.,,
Satisfied,I wish you would not charge tax (just have it already added in the book price). Also I miss getting a receipt with my order.,,
Satisfied,I work in the school library and would like to have the links to several age group flyers available in the email that gets auto created.,,
Satisfied,"I would love the flyers to be sent out again. It is a great way to help those purchase books, by seeing the item.",,
Satisfied,"I'd love Free shipping, or some bonus to get free shipping.  I can't control whether many of my students order books or not.  With a $25 minimum, I have to send the book orders home less often to be sure more kids order books, so that I don't have to pay for shipping.  I'm just not willing to spend my money to pay shipping for my students' books.    Maybe there could be a minimum order amount for individual families to order and have it sent to school or home??",,
Satisfied,"It was difficult to access the dollar books, even though I had earned them.  Also tough to gain access to the visa funds I had from last year.",,
Satisfied,It wouldn't let me enter my $5 free book.,,
Satisfied,Just deleting names from my contact list...it didn't transfer over nicely or communicate with google well.,,
Satisfied,"Last year when the orders arrived, each child's order was printed on a tear apart slip. This made it easy and efficient to sort large orders and ensure that all of the correct books were sent with each child. We also were able to send this slip with the books as a receipt showing the parent that they had received all we have record of them ordering,    This order I received had three pages of books listed and some of the student orders were in different places on different pages,    If possible, the tear apart slips or a place online to reference the orders would be great!  Thanks for all you do,  Melanie Coffelt",,
Satisfied,My child's teacher was listed at her former school. I let her know so she can update it.,,
Satisfied,My students really like the paper flyers but we have not received any this school year.  Will they be sent in the future?,,
Satisfied,N/A,,
Satisfied,Need to make sure that I will be receiving my flyers at my site this year for each month. They did not come directly to me but came in bundles with other schools from the district in it. I often missed the flyers altogether because they never arrived at our site and I would have to call scholastic to send the flyers directly to me and that took a few days for them to arrive.,,
Satisfied,none,,
Satisfied,None at this time,,
Satisfied,"Not many parents are ordering books anymore.  I used to have huge book orders in the past.  Since my class didn't order 25 dollars worth, I missed out on the great coupon offers.  I don't want to add my own money to orders in order to get 10 dollars free.  Possibly add a 5 dollars free to the classroom that is under the 25 dollar mark.",,
Satisfied,"Since the pandemic, I have not been getting the student flyers sent to school.  I REALLY want them to generate more orders.  PLEASE send them to school.  I emailed last year and sat on hold for a time to talk to a Rep about this and still have not received the paper flyers.",,
Satisfied,"Some item numbers didn’t match the flyers, but overall, easy to shop and place my order!",,
Satisfied,The $10 to spend right now window was not available and I couldn't complete my order,,
Satisfied,The coupon code for a free book expired before the book order is even due. That’s frustrating!,,
Satisfied,the email that is associated with my account isn't a valid email for some reason.  i could't change my forgotten password because the email isn't correct.,,
Satisfied,Trying to edit my order since this teacher is no longer at Pikeside Pre-K in Martinsburg WV on Winchester avenue and it won't let me.,,
Satisfied,"trying to figure out how many bonus points I have  *thank you for all the great prices, bonuses, shipping :)",,
Satisfied,When selecting free books it would be nice to see the covers and authors.,,
Satisfied,Where do I mail my payment,,
Satisfied,will be processing order on Sunday waiting for a few more parents to order,,
Satisfied,Yesterday I submitted a student online order and mailed a student order and today I had another student online order. Since my orders were submitted on different days I was not able to receive any bonus points or rewards. Is there any way to get those credits?,,
Very Disappointed,Hard to follow….almost made me quit the purchase…also should have option to purchase as a guest and give paypal option,,
Very Disappointed,I am frankly disgusted by Scholastic's false promises of free books for teachers.  I am far to busy to waste my time on nonsense.  I will inform my classroom parents that Scholastic has repeatedly failed to uphold its promises to reward teachers with free books for student purchase therefore I will no longer distribute monthly book order forms.  They can go to retail book shops in the future.,,
Very Disappointed,"I am ordering $30 worth of books, the coupon ""READS"" still shows in the banner and I can not apply y free book.",,
Very Disappointed,I couldnt use the READS coupon code.,,
Very Disappointed,I have just placed my last order with your company.  You failed to honor your advertised rewards for teachers when students place orders.  I'm done with your company.  My time is too valuable to do your advertising for free.  No more!  Do not send me any more flyers.  I am done!,,
Very Disappointed,"I ran out of during this visit to the website, but I will be placing my order shortly. :)",,
Very Disappointed,I s till do not know how to submit an order with money brought to me by a student that is in cash - I have to pay out of pocket up front for this?,,
Very Disappointed,"If you are going to advertise a promotion like READS, you should take it down if it's no longer available, which is the message that appears in my cart when I am ordering well over the required amount.   You're being very misleading in your advertising.   But for supporting our teacher through the promotion you are giving to teachers whose parents place orders before September 30th, this experience makes me not want to shop from Scholastic again.",,
Very Disappointed,"Options to pay previous account balances online, not via telephone for ALL. Offer National Geographic novels in higher levels.",,
Very Disappointed,signing up i did not get points or neither did the person who shared. Also the sign up was really buggy.,,
Very Disappointed,Stop sending me emails and stop producing sooooo many flyers that I simply recycle. Stop!!!!!,,
Very Disappointed,"The code says expired. I did what the person in chat said to do and it still doesn't work. I don't think I will be ordering, at least online, again any time soon",,
Very Disappointed,"The flyer from the teacher, does NOT match on-line.",,
Very Disappointed,This was such a terrible experience.  What books come in the five book bonus pack? How do you pay for the dollar books?  How does the teacher  purchase books for the classroom from the flyer?  What are thee bonus points for? If I send you the paper order how do I know who gets what? Come on scholastic- make it stress free for the teacher too!,,
Very Satisfied,A parent wrote a check to Scholastic while the rest of the parents sent cash.  I paid for everything on my debit card.  This means I need to contact the parent who wrote a check to you and ask them to rewrite it.,,
Very Satisfied,Adding to wish lists so that when I can get class codes (teachers haven't been updated for this year).,,
Very Satisfied,"Biggest challenge was figuring out which books were in a boxed series. I was shopping for the Magic Tree House series and needed a specific ""next"" box set. I couldn't easily distinguish which set was the correct one for me to select. The numbers were not listed in the title of the product.",,
Very Satisfied,"Christon was very helpful. I didn't get to tell them because  I clicked something and the chat disappeared from screen, though  I heard a couple extra messages.",,
Very Satisfied,Codes did not match my pamphlet,,
Very Satisfied,Excellent!  Much easier to use than the old format of the site.,,
Very Satisfied,"hi just got the flyers i requested but I guess I didn't ask for the Lucky flyers or any that would be good for second graders.    In the future could you please send me any flyers See Saw, Lucky, you can be a reader, that  second graders would order from...  Thanks   Sarah Cox  2nd grade teacher  Holland Hall School  5666 E. 81   Tulsa, Ok 74137",,
Very Satisfied,I am not sure that I fixed my problem.  I have not been receiving flyers this year.  I tried to update my class info again in hopes they will start coming!,,
Very Satisfied,I couldn't find teacher's name. I will wait to get her class code to submit my order as I noted that purchases help teachers get free books for the classrooms. Thanks,,
Very Satisfied,"I couldnt pay with my international card, or my international paypal",,
Very Satisfied,I didn’t get the promo code to work,,
Very Satisfied,"I do not see my Bonus Points for Teacher Referrals:  Briana Snyder  Alex Castellanos  Also, how do get the 300 bonus points for ordering before September 30th.  Please advise.",,

Very Satisfied,I look forward to coming back as a classroom teacher. :),,
Very Satisfied,I love scholastic book club. It has been a slow start after the pandemic but I am hoping this year will blossom with readers!    I loved your videos they were so helpful in doing the things I needed to get done!,,
Very Satisfied,I placed an order for my class yesterday 9/16/2022 by phone. I did not have any online orders. However a student placed an on line order this morning so I placed this order today. It was very easy to place this on line order.,,
Very Satisfied,I see there is now a minimum $25 in order to receive the free shipping. There are times I have had only a couple parents order and my total amount is under this. I as a teacher would NOT want to incur the $6.50 S&H fee.,,
Very Satisfied,I want to get back to Scholastic Book Clubs to help my students build their reading skills. I look forward to recving  the order forms.,,
Very Satisfied,I was just adding a student order today and doing a little classroom shopping.,,
Very Satisfied,"I was very happy to have immediate help from ""Ronda"" on the live chat. She was able to find the information I needed in a timely manner and was quite courteous.    I was a little surprised to find that I could not look up the amount in my child's E-wallet without the help of Ronda, I have the tendency to think I've done something, but in fact just thought about doing it and I needed to make absolute sure that my daughter wouldn't be showing up on book fair day, unable to purchase anything with her class.      Other than the ability to check the amount in your child's E-wallet easily, everything else ran smoothly.",,
Very Satisfied,"I went in today to modify my profile for my new school & role. I wish there was a way that I could indicate that I am not a classroom teacher, I am a support specialist. I still order books to use with students, but I don't need you to send me class flyers.  Is there a way for me to do this?",,
Very Satisfied,I will be submitting an order next week. I had a parent ask for me to hold off until the weekend.,,
Very Satisfied,I will most likely submit an order this month. The only reason I didn't do it today is because I am waiting for my class due date before I submit.,,
Very Satisfied,I will place my personal order when students have placed their orders.,,
Very Satisfied,I'm just pre shopping of our next book order for Christmas gift ideas.,,
Very Satisfied,Just checking on student orders submitted online.  I will submit them on Friday.,,
Very Satisfied,Just checking up on my class order which is due later this week.,,
Very Satisfied,"Just wondering if parents could be prompted to select a free book when their order is over $25.  I have a family that earned a free book, but didn't make a selection.  It would be nice if they could be prompted for these rewards just like teacher's have on their checkout page.",,
Very Satisfied,Looking forward to ordering book for this school year.,,
Very Satisfied,Love scholastic!! Kids need to hold books.,,
Very Satisfied,Much easier to use this year.,,
Very Satisfied,"My customer # has changed, and the number of spaces for my customer # is different than what is on the envelope.",,

Very Satisfied,The READS coupon didn’t work :(,,
Very Satisfied,This site seems to work very well. I DO wish that when I chose my free $5.00 book that I would have been given the option to choose the book OR make an additional donation to the donation area. Spread even more of the love!,,
Very Satisfied,This visit to the site was to get a game plan for which books I will be purchasing within a day or so...I just didn't purchase any at this moment.,,
Very Satisfied,Trying to make a payment,,
Very Satisfied,Was trying to find the $1 books to give out as gifts for my students and my daughter's class.,,
